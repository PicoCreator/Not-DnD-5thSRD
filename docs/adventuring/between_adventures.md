# Between Adventures 
In the days between daring quests and battles against the forces of darkness, adventurers must take time to rest, recover, and ready themselves for their next journey. Many also use this time to craft weapons and armor, conduct research, or spend their hard-earned gold.

At times, the passage of time may occur without much fanfare or description. When beginning a new adventure, the Game Master may simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow the players to describe in general terms what their characters have been doing. Other times, the GM may wish to keep track of the exact amount of time that has passed as events beyond the characters' perception continue to unfold. 

## Lifestyle Expenses 
Between adventures, characters may choose a particular lifestyle and pay the cost of maintaining it.

Living a certain lifestyle does not have a huge effect on the character, but it can affect the way other individuals and groups react to them. For example, if a character leads an aristocratic lifestyle, they may find it easier to influence the nobles of the city than if they lived in poverty. 

## Downtime Activities 
Between adventures, the GM may ask the players what their characters are doing during their downtime. These periods of downtime can vary in length, but each activity requires a certain number of days to complete before any benefit is gained, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the activity for it to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If the character has more than the minimum amount of days to spend, they can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.

The GM may allow other downtime activities not listed here. If a character wishes to spend their downtime performing an activity not covered, they should discuss it with the GM. 

### Crafting 
Characters may craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. They must be proficient with the tools related to the object they are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). They may also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith's tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.

For every day of downtime spent crafting, the character can create one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and they must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something they want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, they make progress every day in 5-gp increments until they reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by themselves.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.

While crafting, the character can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost. 

### Practicing a Profession 
Characters may work between adventures, allowing them to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long as they continue to practice their profession.

If they are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves' guild, they earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.

If they have proficiency in the Performance skill and put their performance skill to use during their downtime, they earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead. 

### Recuperating 
Characters may use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.

After three days of downtime spent recuperating, they can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, they can choose one of the following results:

* End one effect on them that prevents them from regaining hit points.
* For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting them.

### Researching 
The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfolded over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over ancient tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.

When the character begins their research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on their research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require them to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information they seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, they learn the information if it is available.

For each day of research, they must spend 1 gp to cover their expenses. This cost is in addition to their normal lifestyle expenses. 

### Training 
Characters may spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. The GM may allow additional training options.

First, they must find an instructor willing to teach them. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.

The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After they spend the requisite amount of time and money, they learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.
