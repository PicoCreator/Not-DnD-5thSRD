# Armor 
The world of fantasy gaming is a vast and varied landscape, with many different cultures and levels of technology. Adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, from leather to chain mail to expensive plate armor, and many more in between. The Armor table below collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and divides them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors also use a shield to supplement their armor.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor used in fantasy gaming worlds.

**Armor Proficiency.** Anybody can put on a suit of armor or attach a shield to their arm, but only those who are proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you are not proficient in, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you cannot cast spells.

**Armor Class (AC).** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.

**Heavy Armor.** Heavier armor restricts the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows "Str 13" or "Str 15" in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

**Stealth.** If the Armor table shows "Disadvantage" in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

**Shields.** Shields are made from wood or metal and are held in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can only benefit from one shield at a time. 

## Light Armor 
Light armor is made from supple and thin materials, and is favored by agile adventurers as it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

**Padded.** Padded armor is composed of quilted layers of cloth and batting.

**Leather.** The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been hardened by boiling in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.

**Studded Leather.** Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.
## Medium Armour
Medium armour provides more protection than light armour, yet it also impedes movement more. If you don a medium armour, you may add your Dexterity modifier, up to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armour type to determine your Armour Class.

**Hide.** This rudimentary armour is composed of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, wicked humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armour.

**Chain Shirt.** Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armour offers modest protection to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.

**Scale Mail.** This armour consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.

**Breastplate.** This armour consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armour provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.

**Half Plate.** Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer's body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps. 

## Heavy Armour 
Of all the armour categories, heavy armour offers the best protection. These suits of armour cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.

Heavy armour does not permit you to add your Dexterity modifier to your Armour Class, but it also does not penalise you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

**Ring Mail.** This armour is leather armour with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armour against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it is usually worn only by those who cannot afford better armour.

**Chain Mail.** Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.

**Splint.** This armour is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.

**Plate.** Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armour. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.

## Donning and Doffing Armor 

The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category.

**Don.** This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor's AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.

**Doff.** This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have assistance, reduce this time by half.

| Category      | Don        | Doff      |
|---------------|------------|-----------|
| Light Armor   | 1 minute   | 1 minute  |
| Medium Armor  | 5 minutes  | 1 minute  |
| Heavy Armor   | 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Shield        | 1 action   | 1 action  |
