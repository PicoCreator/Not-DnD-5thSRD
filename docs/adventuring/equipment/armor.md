# Armor
In the fantastical realms of gaming, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, from supple leather to heavy plate mail. The Armor table below details the most commonly available armors, divided into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors also choose to supplement their armor with a shield.

**Armor Proficiency.** Anybody can don a suit of armor or strap a shield to their arm, but only those proficient in its use can wear it effectively. Your class grants you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency in, you suffer disadvantage on any Strength or Dexterity-based ability checks, saving throws, or attack rolls, and you cannot cast spells.

**Armor Class (AC).** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.

**Heavy Armor.** Heavier armor impedes the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows "Str 13" or "Str 15" in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

**Stealth.** If the Armor table shows "Disadvantage" in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

**Shields.** Shields are crafted from wood or metal and are held in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can only benefit from one shield at a time. 

## Light Armor 
Light armor is crafted from supple and thin materials, allowing agile adventurers to remain mobile while still receiving some protection. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

**Padded.** Padded armor is composed of quilted layers of cloth and batting.

**Leather.** This armor is made of leather that has been hardened by boiling in oil, with the rest of the armor crafted from softer and more flexible materials.

**Studded Leather.** This tough but flexible leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.
## Medium Armor
Medium armor provides a greater degree of protection than light armor, but it also restricts movement more. If you don a medium armor, you may add your Dexterity modifier, up to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

**Hide.** This rudimentary armor is composed of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbaric tribes, malevolent humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials necessary to craft better armor.

**Chain Shirt.** Constructed of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers a moderate level of protection to the wearer's upper body and muffles the sound of the rings rubbing against one another.

**Scale Mail.** This armor is composed of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.

**Breastplate.** This armor is composed of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively exposed, this armor provides excellent protection for the wearer's vital organs while allowing the wearer to remain relatively unencumbered.

**Half Plate.** Half plate is composed of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer's body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps. 

## Heavy Armor 
Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to repel a wide range of attacks. Only the most experienced warriors can manage their weight and bulk.

Heavy armor does not permit you to add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also does not penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

**Ring Mail.** This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help to reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it is usually worn only by those who cannot afford better armor.

**Chain Mail.** Constructed of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.

**Splint.** This armor is composed of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.

**Plate.** Plate is composed of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.

## Donning and Doffing Armor 

The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category.

**Donning.** This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor's AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.

**Doffing.** This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have assistance, reduce this time by half.

| Category      | Donning        | Doffing      |
|---------------|------------|-----------|
| Light Armor   | 1 minute   | 1 minute  |
| Medium Armor  | 5 minutes  | 1 minute  |
| Heavy Armor   | 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Shield        | 1 action   | 1 action  |
