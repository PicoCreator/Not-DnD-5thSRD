# Coins 
In the ancient world, coins of various metals were used to represent the relative worth of goods and services. The three most common coins were the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).

A single gold piece could purchase a bedroll, fifty feet of good rope, or a goat. Skilled artisans could earn one gold piece a day. Gold pieces were the standard measure of wealth, even if the coins themselves were not commonly used. When merchants discussed deals involving hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions were usually conducted with gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.

One gold piece was worth ten silver pieces, which were the most common coins among commoners. A silver piece could buy a laborer's work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.

One silver piece was worth ten copper pieces, which were common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece could buy a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.

In addition, coins made of other precious metals could sometimes be found in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) were relics of fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they often caused suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece was worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece was worth ten gold pieces.

A standard coin weighed about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weighed a pound.
