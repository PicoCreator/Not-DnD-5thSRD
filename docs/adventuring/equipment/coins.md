# Coins 
Various coins of different worth are used in this realm, the most common being the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).

A gold piece can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled artisan can earn one gold piece a day. Gold pieces are the standard measure of wealth, and transactions involving hundreds or thousands of gold pieces are usually done through gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.

One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, which are the most common coins among commoners. A silver piece can buy a laborer's work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.

One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.

In addition, coins made of other precious metals may be found in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) are from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and may be met with suspicion when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.

A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.
