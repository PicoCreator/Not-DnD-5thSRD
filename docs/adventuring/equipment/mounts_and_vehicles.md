# Mounts and Vehicles
In the wilds, a trusty mount can help you traverse the land with greater speed and ease. The Mounts and Other Animals table below shows the speed and base carrying capacity of each animal.

When an animal is pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon, it can move up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals are pulling the same vehicle, their carrying capacities can be added together.

In some fantasy gaming worlds, there are more exotic mounts available, such as flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and the like) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Such mounts are rare and not normally available for purchase, and often require special means to acquire, such as hatching an egg, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.

**Barding.** Barding is armor designed to protect an animal’s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be purchased as barding, though it costs four times as much and weighs twice as much as armor made for humanoids.

**Saddles.** A military saddle helps the rider stay mounted in battle, granting advantage on any check made to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount.

**Vehicle Proficiency.** If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.

**Rowed Vessels.** Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) is added to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.
