# Selling of Treasures
In the dungeons and wilds of the world, adventurers may find a wealth of riches and trinkets to bring back with them. These items can be sold in the markets of towns and settlements, provided one can find a buyer or merchant willing to take them.

**Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.** Generally, weapons, armor, and other equipment that remain in good condition can be sold for half their worth. However, items used by monsters are rarely in a state to be sold.

**Magic Items.** Selling magical items can be a difficult task, as they are often too valuable for all but the wealthiest of nobles. Aside from a few common magic items, it is rare to find items or spells to purchase. Magic is a commodity of great worth and should be treated as such.

**Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects.** These items retain their full value in the market, and can be used as currency or traded in for coin. For particularly valuable treasures, it may be necessary to find a buyer in a larger town or city.

**Trade Goods.** In the borderlands, bartering is a common form of transaction. Trade goods such as iron bars, salt bags, and livestock retain their full value and can be used as currency.
