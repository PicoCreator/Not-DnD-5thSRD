# Selling of Treasures
In the dungeons and caves of the world, adventurers may find a variety of treasures, weapons, armor, and more. When they return to a settlement, they may be able to sell their spoils, provided they can find merchants and buyers interested in their loot.

**Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.** Generally, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment can be sold for half their cost in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to be sold.

**Magic Items.** Selling magic items can be difficult. Potions and scrolls may be easier to find buyers for, but other items may be beyond the means of all but the wealthiest nobles. Aside from a few common magic items, it is unlikely that one will find magic items or spells to purchase. Magic is a valuable commodity and should be treated as such.

**Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects.** These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and can be exchanged for coin or used as currency for other transactions. For particularly valuable treasures, the GM may require the adventurers to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.

**Trade Goods.** In the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Trade goods such as iron bars, salt bags, and livestock retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.
