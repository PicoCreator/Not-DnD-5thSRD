# Tools 
The tools of a skilled artisan are invaluable, allowing them to craft and repair items, forge documents, and pick locks. Those blessed with the knowledge of a particular tool can add their proficiency bonus to any ability check they make when using it. Proficiency with a tool is not limited to a single ability, as it represents a broader understanding of its use. For example, a Dexterity check may be required to carve a fine detail with woodcarving tools, or a Strength check to work with particularly hard wood.

**Artisan's Tools.** These special tools are essential for any craft or trade. The table below shows examples of the most common types of tools, each providing items related to a single craft. Proficiency with a set of artisan's tools allows one to add their proficiency bonus to any ability checks they make when using the tools in their craft. Each type of artisan's tools requires a separate proficiency.

**Gaming Set.** This item encompasses a wide range of game pieces, including dice and decks of cards (for games such as Three-Dragon Ante).

If one is proficient with a gaming set, they can add their proficiency bonus to ability checks they make to play a game with that set. Each type of gaming set requires a separate proficiency.
