# Trade Goods of Old
Most wealth is not measured in coins, but rather in livestock, grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a mine or a forest).

Guilds, nobles, and royalty all have a hand in regulating trade. Companies are granted certain rights to conduct trade along certain routes, to send merchant ships to various ports, or to buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set prices for the goods or services that they control, and determine who may or may not offer those goods and services. Merchants commonly exchange trade goods without using currency, and the following table shows the value of commonly exchanged goods.
