In this fantastical world, warriors and adventurers alike must be well-versed in the use of weapons to survive. From the trusty longsword to the powerful longbow, the right weapon and the skill to wield it can mean the difference between life and death.

The Weapons table below details the most common weapons used in this realm, including their price, weight, damage, and any special properties they possess. Weapons are divided into two categories: melee and ranged. A **melee weapon** is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, while a **ranged weapon** is used to attack a target at a distance.

## Weapon Proficiency 
Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. These categories are **simple** and **martial**. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency, such as clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll. 

## Weapon Properties 
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

**Ammunition.** If your weapon has the ammunition property, you must have ammunition to fire it. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

**Finesse.** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you can choose to use either your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**Heavy.** Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons, as they are too large for them to use effectively.

**Light.** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

**Loading.** Weapons with the loading property require time to reload, so you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

**Range.** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

**Reach.** This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

**Special.** A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description.

**Thrown.** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

**Two-Handed.** This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property--the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack. 

## Weapons of Chance
At times, a hero may find themselves without their trusty blade or bow, and must rely on whatever is at hand to defend themselves. An improvised weapon can be any object that can be wielded with one or two hands, such as a broken bottle, a chair leg, a skillet, a wagon wheel, or a fallen foe.

In some cases, an improvised weapon may be similar to a true weapon, and the wielder may be able to use their proficiency bonus when attacking with it. If the object bears no resemblance to a weapon, it will deal 1d4 damage (the GM should assign a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it will also deal 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

## Silver-Tipped Weapons
Some creatures that are immune or resistant to nonmagical weapons may be vulnerable to silver-tipped weapons. A hero may choose to invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver, which can be done to a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gold pieces. This cost not only covers the price of the silver, but also the time and expertise needed to add the silver without compromising the weapon's effectiveness. 

## Special Weapons 
Weapons with special rules are described here.

**Lance.** When attempting to strike a target within five feet of you, you are at a disadvantage. Additionally, a lance must be wielded with two hands when not mounted.

**Net.** A net is capable of restraining a creature of Large size or smaller until it is freed. Formless creatures, as well as those of Huge size or larger, are unaffected by a net. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Alternatively, dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) will free the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
