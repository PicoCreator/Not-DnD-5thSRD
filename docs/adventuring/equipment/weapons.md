description: Rules and information about different weapon types and properties, adapted for a different game world.

# Arms 
Your class grants skill in certain arms, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

The Arms table shows the most common arms used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their cost and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A **melee weapon** is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a **ranged weapon** is used to attack a target at a distance.


## Weapon Proficiency 
Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are **simple** and **martial**. Most people can use simple arms with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other arms often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these arms put their fighting style and training to best use.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll. 

## Weapon Properties 
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Arms table.

**Ammunition.** You can use an arm that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons" later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

**Finesse.** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**Heavy.** Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

**Light.** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

**Loading.** Because of the time required to load this arm, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

**Range.** An arm that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

**Reach.** This arm adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

**Special.** An arm with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see "Special Weapons" later in this section).

**Thrown.** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

**Two-Handed.** This arm requires two hands when you attack with it.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property--the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
## Weapons of Improvisation
At times, characters may find themselves without their weapons and must make do with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon can be any object that can be wielded with one or two hands, such as a shard of glass, a table leg, a skillet, a wagon wheel, or a slain goblin.

In some cases, an improvised weapon may be similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM's discretion, a character proficient with a weapon may use a similar object as if it were that weapon and apply their proficiency bonus.

Objects that bear no resemblance to a weapon deal 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. 

## Silver-Plated Weapons
Certain monsters that are immune or resistant to nonmagical weapons may be vulnerable to silver-plated weapons. Adventurers who wish to be prepared for such encounters may invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. One weapon or ten pieces of ammunition can be silvered for 100 gp. This cost covers not only the price of the silver, but also the time and expertise required to add silver to the weapon without compromising its effectiveness.
## Special Weapons 
Weapons with special rules are described here.

**Lance.** When attacking a target within 5 feet of you, you have disadvantage when using a lance. Additionally, a lance requires two hands to wield when not mounted.

**Net.** A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Alternatively, dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) will free the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

When attacking with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make, using an action, bonus action, or reaction.
