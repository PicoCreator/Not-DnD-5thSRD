# The Realms of Existence
The universe is filled with a multitude of worlds and a vast array of alternate dimensions, known as the **realms of existence**. It encompasses every world where Game Masters run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane lies domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.

Many spells and magical items can draw energy from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character grows in power and level, you may find yourself walking on streets of solid fire or testing your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn. 

## The Material Plane 
The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the chaotic existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.

The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-ravaged desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned. 

## Beyond the Material 
Beyond the Material Plane, the various realms of existence are lands of myth and mystery. They are not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world. 

### Planar Travel 
When adventurers travel into other realms of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the domains of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.

Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.

**Spells.** A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other realms of existence. **_Plane shift_** and **_gate_** can transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision. **_Etherealness_** allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches--such as the Elemental Planes. And the **_astral projection_** spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.

**Portals.** A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations-- circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns--that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).

The cosmos is teeming with a multitude of worlds and a myriad of alternate dimensions, known as the **realms of existence**.

### The Grand Realms 
The Grand Realms are a wondrous and mysterious place, filled with the secrets of the ages. It is said that these planes are the birthplace of all creation, and the source of all magic. 

The two most prominent planes are the Ethereal and Astral Planes, known as the Transitive Planes. These planes are mostly featureless, but serve as pathways between the other planes. Spells such as etherealness and astral projection allow characters to traverse these planes and reach the planes beyond. 

The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension, often described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the see invisibility and true seeing spells grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as forcecage and wall of force. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.

The Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain. 

The Inner Planes are the source of all matter and energy, and surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes. The four Elemental Planes--Air, Earth, Fire, and Water--form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning Elemental Chaos. At their innermost edges, the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane, with land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile, with the elements existing in their purest form. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos. 

The Outer Planes are the realms of thought and spirit, and are best known as the homes of deities. These planes are not literally "places" at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them. The planes with some element of good in their nature are called the Upper Planes, and celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the Lower Planes, and fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. 

Finally, there are the Demiplanes, small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don't seem to fit anywhere else, and come into being by a variety of means. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane, or by using a plane shift or gate spell. 

The Grand Realms are a place of mystery and wonder, and those who venture there will find a world of adventure and discovery.
