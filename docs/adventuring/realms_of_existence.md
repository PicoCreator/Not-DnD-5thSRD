Description: Descriptions of the different realms of existence in an oldern english style.

# The Realms of Existence 
The universe is filled with a multitude of worlds and a myriad of alternate dimensions of reality, known as the **realms of existence**. It encompasses every world where GMs run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that realm are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.

Many spells and magical items can draw energy from these realms, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater power and higher levels, you may walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn. 

## The Material Realm 
The Material Realm is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other realms collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.

The worlds of the Material Realm are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned. 

## Beyond the Material 
Beyond the Material Plane, the various realms of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They are not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world. 

### Realm Travel 
When adventurers travel into other realms of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.

Travel to the realms beyond the Material Realm can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a realm portal.

**Spells.** A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other realms of existence. **_Plane shift_** and **_gate_** can transport adventurers directly to any other realm of existence, with different degrees of precision. **_Etherealness_** allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Realm and travel from there to any of the realms it touches--such as the Elemental Realms. And the **_astral projection_** spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Realm and travel to the Outer Realms.

**Portals.** A portal is a general term for a stationary interrealm connection that links a specific location on one realm to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interrealm travel. Others are locations-- circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns--that exist in multiple realms at once or flicker from one realm to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Realm with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Realm of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Realm of Water).
### Transitive Realms 
The Ethereal Realm and the Astral Realm are known as the Transitive Realms, and are mostly featureless planes that serve as pathways between other realms. Spells such as **_etherealness_** and **_astral projection_** allow characters to traverse these realms and reach the realms beyond.

The **Ethereal Plane** is a fog-filled dimension, often described as a great ocean. Its edges, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Realm and the Inner Realms, so that each location on those realms has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the **_see invisibility_** and **_true seeing_** spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Realm into the Border Ethereal, particularly those that use force energy such as **_forcecage_** and **_wall of force_**. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and vibrant fogs.

The **Astral Plane** is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the realms of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with streaks of white and gray among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Realm is an endless, open domain. 


### Inner Realms 
The Inner Realms encompass the Material Realm and its echoes, providing the elemental substance from which all the worlds were made. The four **Elemental Realms**--Air, Earth, Fire, and Water--form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the turbulent **Elemental Chaos**.

At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Realm (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Realms resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Realms are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form--vast expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when discussing the Realm of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Realms, the pure elements dissolve and blend together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos. 

### Outer Realms 
If the Inner Realms are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Realms are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Realms as divine realms, spiritual realms, or godly realms, for the Outer Realms are best known as the homes of deities.

When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally "places" at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Realms are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Realms, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Realms as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.

Even in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Realms appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Realms. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these realms can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.

Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Realms. The perceptible regions of the realms often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day--if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.

The most well-known Outer Realms are a group of sixteen realms that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them. 

#### Outer Realms 
The realms with some element of good in their nature are called the **Upper Realms**. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Realms. Realms with some element of evil are the **Lower Realms**. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Realms. A plane's alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn't match the plane's experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable. 

#### Demirealms 
Demirealms are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don't seem to fit anywhere else. Demirealms come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as **_demiplane_**, or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a **_plane shift_** spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The **_gate_** spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.
