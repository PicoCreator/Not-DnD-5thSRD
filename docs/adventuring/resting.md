Adventurers of yore must take time to rest and recover from their arduous journeys. A short rest is a period of at least one hour in which a character can partake in activities such as eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds. At the end of a short rest, a character can spend one or more Hit Dice, up to their maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to their level. For each Hit Die spent, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total.

A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character can sleep or perform light activities such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity, the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it. At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points and spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them (minimum of one die). A character cannot benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.
