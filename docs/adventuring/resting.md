Description: Rules for resting and recovering in a fantasy game world.

# Taking Rest 
Though they may be brave and courageous, adventurers cannot spend every hour of the day in the midst of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They must take time to rest, to sleep and eat, to tend to their wounds, to refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and to prepare themselves for further adventures.

Adventurers can take short rests during the day and a long rest to end the day. 

## Short Rest 
A short rest is a period of downtime, lasting at least one hour, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

At the end of a short rest, a character may spend one or more Hit Dice, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below. 

## Long Rest 
A long rest is a period of extended downtime, lasting at least eight hours, during which a character sleeps or performs light activities such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than two hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity--at least one hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity--the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.

At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.

A character cannot benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least one hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.
