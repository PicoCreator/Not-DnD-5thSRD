# Time
In situations where tracking the passage of time is of importance, the GM shall determine the time a task requires. Depending on the context of the situation, the GM may use a different time scale. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers' movement is on a scale of **minutes**. It takes them a minute to traverse a long hallway, another minute to inspect the door for traps, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber for anything of value.

In a city or wilderness, a scale of **hours** is more suitable. Adventurers who wish to reach the isolated tower in the forest can make the fifteen mile journey in four hours.

For long journeys, a scale of **days** is best. The adventurers who travel from Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep spend four days before they are ambushed by goblins.

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on **rounds**, a 6-second span of time.
