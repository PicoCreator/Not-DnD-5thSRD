In a world of adventure and peril, the passage of time is of utmost importance. The Game Master shall determine the amount of time a task requires, and may adjust the scale of time depending on the situation. 

In a dungeon, the adventurers' movements are measured in **minutes**. It may take a minute to traverse a long hallway, another minute to check for traps, and a good ten minutes to search a chamber for anything of value.

In a city or wilderness, the scale of **hours** is more suitable. A group of adventurers may traverse fifteen miles in four hours.

For long journeys, the scale of **days** is best. A journey from Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep may take four days, though it may be interrupted by unexpected events.

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on **rounds**, a span of six seconds.
