In this game world, alignment is a combination of two factors: one that identifies morality and the other that describes attitudes towards society and order. These nine alignments define the possible combinations, and each one describes the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. 

Lawful Good (LG) creatures are expected to do the right thing according to society's standards. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are examples of this alignment.

Neutral Good (NG) creatures strive to help others according to their needs. Celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are examples of this alignment.

Chaotic Good (CG) creatures act according to their conscience, disregarding what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are examples of this alignment.

Lawful Neutral (LN) creatures act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Monks and some wizards are examples of this alignment.

Neutral (N) creatures prefer to stay away from moral questions and do what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are examples of this alignment.

Chaotic Neutral (CN) creatures follow their whims, prioritizing their personal freedom above all else. Barbarians, rogues, and some bards are examples of this alignment.

Lawful Evil (LE) creatures take what they want within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are examples of this alignment.

Neutral Evil (NE) creatures do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are examples of this alignment.

Chaotic Evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are examples of this alignment.

For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. The evil deities who created other races made them to serve them, and they have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments - they are unaligned. Such creatures are incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and act according to their bestial nature.
