# Backgrounds
Every tale has a beginning, and your character's background reveals where they have come from, how they became an adventurer, and their place in the world. Your fighter may have been a valiant knight or a hardened soldier. Your wizard may have been a sage or a craftsman. Your rogue may have made a living as a guild thief or entertained crowds as a jester.

Choosing a background provides you with important clues about your character's identity. The most important question to ask about your background is **what changed**? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? How did you acquire the funds to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you have **more** money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from the ordinary folk who share your background?

The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both tangible benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions. 

### Proficiencies 
Each background grants a character proficiency in two skills.

In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools.

If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, they may instead choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool). 

### Languages 
Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by their race.

### Equipment 
Each character's background provides a bundle of starting equipment. If the optional rule of spending coin on gear is employed, the starting equipment from the background is not received. 

### Suggested Characteristics 
A background contains recommended personal characteristics based on the character's background. Players may select characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as a source of inspiration for characteristics of their own creation. Customizing a Background 
If one wishes to customize a background to better fit the character or the campaign setting, they may replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. The equipment package from the background may be used, or coin may be spent on gear as described in the equipment section. (If coin is spent, the equipment package suggested for the class cannot be taken.) Finally, two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw must be chosen. If a feature that matches the desired background cannot be found, the GM and player should work together to create one.

## Acolyte 
You have devoted your life to the service of a temple devoted to a particular deity or pantheon of gods. You act as a bridge between the divine and the mortal world, performing sacred rituals and offering sacrifices to bring worshippers into the presence of the divine. You may not be a cleric - performing sacred rituals is not the same as channeling divine power.

Choose a god, pantheon of gods, or other quasi-divine being from the list of "Fantasy--Historical Pantheons" or those specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a humble servant in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in their sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly felt a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even a secret society that served a fiendish master that you now deny. 

**Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Religion    
**Languages:** Two of your choice    
**Equipment:** A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp

## Acolyte 
You have devoted your life to the service of a temple devoted to a particular deity or pantheon of gods. You act as a mediator between the realm of the divine and the mortal world, performing sacred rituals and offering sacrifices to bring worshippers into the presence of the divine. You may not be a cleric - performing sacred rituals is not the same as channeling divine power.

Choose a god, pantheon of gods, or other quasi-divine being from the list of "Fantasy--Historical Pantheons" or those specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a humble acolyte in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in their sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly felt a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even a clandestine society that served a fiendish master that you now deny.

### Feature: Haven of the Devout 
As a pious one, you command the reverence of those who share your faith, and you can perform the sacred rites of your deity. You and your fellow adventurers can anticipate to receive free healing and succor at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a humble lifestyle.

You may also have ties to a particular temple devoted to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a domicile there. This could be the temple where you once served, if you remain in good standing with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. Whilst in the vicinity of your temple, you can call upon the priests for aid, provided the aid you seek is not perilous and you remain in good standing with your temple. 

### Characteristics of the Faithful
Acolytes are formed by their experiences in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith, and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies, shape their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws may be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical thought, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

| 2  | I can find common ground between the most bitter of enemies, understanding them and always striving for peace.      |
| 3  | I perceive omens in every event and action. The gods are trying to communicate with us, we just need to listen.     |
| 4  | Nothing can dampen my optimistic outlook.                                                                          |

| 6  | I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the worship of other gods.                  |
| 7  | I have been fortunate enough to experience the finest of foods, drinks, and high society among my temple's elite. Rough living is not for me. |
| 8  | I have spent so much time in the temple that I have little practical experience dealing with people in the outside world. |

| d6 | Ideal                                                                                                                  |
|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Antiquity. The venerated customs of veneration and offering must be kept and observed. (Lawful)                       |
| 2  | Benevolence. I always strive to aid those in need, regardless of the personal cost. (Good)                            |
| 3  | Revolution. We must aid in the transformation that the gods are constantly working in the world. (Chaotic)            |
| 4  | Authority. I aspire to one day ascend to the highest echelons of my faith's religious hierarchy. (Lawful)             |
| 5  | Devotion. I trust that my deity will guide my actions. I have faith that if I work hard, I will be rewarded. (Lawful) |
| 6  | Ambition. I seek to prove myself worthy of my god's favor by adhering to his or her teachings. (Any)                  |

| d6 | Bond                                                                                     |
|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | I would lay down my life to reclaim an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long ago.  |
| 2  | I will one day take vengeance on the corrupt temple hierarchy who branded me a heretic.   |
| 3  | I owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parents passed away.                    |
| 4  | All that I do is for the benefit of the common people.                                    |
| 5  | I will do anything to protect the temple where I served.                                  |
| 6  | I seek to preserve a sacred text that my adversaries deem heretical and seek to destroy.   |

| d6 | Flaw                                                                                     |
|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | I harshly judge others, and even more harshly judge myself.                                |
| 2  | I place too much trust in those who wield power within my temple's hierarchy.              |
| 3  | My piety sometimes leads me to trust blindly those who profess faith in my god.             |
| 4  | I am unbending in my thinking.                                                            |
| 5  | I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them.                                 |
| 6  | Once I set my sights on a goal, I become obsessed with it to the exclusion of all else.   |
