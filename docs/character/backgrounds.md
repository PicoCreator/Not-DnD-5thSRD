# Backgrounds
Every tale has a start. Your character's background unveils where you come from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter may have been a valiant knight or a weathered soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or a craftsman. Your rogue may have made do as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.

Choosing a background gives you with significant story cues about your character's identity. The most important inquiry to ask about your background is **what changed**? Why did you cease doing whatever your background portrays and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you have **more** money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions. 

### Proficiencies 
Each background grants a character proficiency in two skills.

In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools.

If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, they can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead. 

### Languages 
Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race.
### Equipment 
Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you choose to spend coin on gear, you will not receive the starting equipment from your background. 

### Suggested Characteristics 
A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation. Customizing a Background You may wish to alter some of the features of a background to better fit your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you cannot also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you cannot find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.
## Acolyte 
Ye have spent yer life in the service of a temple to a particular deity or pantheon of gods. Ye act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. Ye are not necessarily a cleric - performing sacred rites is not the same as channeling divine power.

Choose a deity, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from among those listed in "Fantasy--Historical Pantheons" or those specified by yer GM, and work with yer GM to detail the nature of yer religious service. Were ye a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were ye a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve yer god in a different way? Mayhap ye were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that ye now deny. 

**Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Religion    
**Languages:** Two of yer choice    
**Equipment:** A holy symbol (a gift to ye when ye entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp
### Feature: Haven of the Devout 
As a faithful one, you command the respect of those who share your beliefs, and you can perform the sacred ceremonies of your deity. You and your companions can expect to receive free healing and aid at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a humble lifestyle.

You may also have ties to a particular temple devoted to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a dwelling there. This could be the temple where you once served, if you remain in good standing with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. Whilst near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not dangerous and you remain in good standing with your temple.
### Characteristics of Note
Acolytes have been shaped by their time spent in temples or other religious communities. Their knowledge of the history and teachings of their faith, as well as their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies, have had an effect on their behavior and ideals. Their flaws may be some hidden hypocrisy or unorthodox thought, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

| 2  | I place too much trust in those who wield power within my temple's hierarchy.              |
