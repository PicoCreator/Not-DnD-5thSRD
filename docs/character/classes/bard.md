* (a) a diplomat’s pack or (b) an entertainer’s pack

### Spellcasting 
- - -
You have learned to manipulate and shape the fabric of reality in accordance with your desires and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can adjust to different situations.

In this world, the power of music and oration is a source of great strength. Those who can wield it are known as Bards, and they are capable of inspiring others with their words and melodies.

Bards know two cantrips of their choice from the Bard spell list, and can learn additional cantrips as they gain higher levels. They also have a number of spell slots to cast spells of 1st level and higher, which they can regain after a long rest.

Bards know four 1st-level spells of their choice from the Bard spell list, and can learn additional spells as they gain higher levels. They can also choose to replace one of the spells they know with another spell from the Bard spell list.

The power of a Bard's spells comes from their Charisma. This is used to set the saving throw DC for a spell they cast, and to make an attack roll with one.

Bards can cast any spell they know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag. They can also use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for their spells.

Bards can also inspire others with their words and music. By using a bonus action on their turn, they can choose one creature within 60 feet of them who can hear them. That creature gains a Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The Bardic Inspiration die changes to a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

Bards can use this feature a number of times equal to their Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). They regain any expended uses when they finish a long rest.

### Jack of All Trades 
- - -
From the second level of your adventuring career, you may add half of your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that does not already include your proficiency bonus. 

### Song of Rest 
- - -
Beginning at the second level of your journey, you may use the power of music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short respite. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.   
The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at the ninth level, to 1d10 at the thirteenth level, and to 1d12 at the seventeenth level. 

### Bard College 
- - -
At the third level of your journey, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at the third level and again at the sixth and fourteenth level. 

### Expertise
- - -
At the third level of your journey, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At the tenth level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit. 

### Ability Score Improvement
- - -
When you reach the fourth level of your journey, and again at the eighth, twelfth, sixteenth, and nineteenth level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by two, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by one. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above twenty using this feature. 

### Font of Inspiration
- - -
Beginning when you reach the fifth level of your journey, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest. 

### Countercharm
- - -
At the sixth level of your journey, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within thirty feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required). 

### Magical Secrets
- - -
By the tenth level of your journey, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.  
The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.  
You learn two additional spells from any class at the fourteenth level and again at the eighteenth level.  

### Superior Inspiration
- - -
At the twentieth level of your journey, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use. 

## College of Lore 
- - -
Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.  
The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.  
The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority. 

#### Bonus Proficiencies 
When you join the College of Lore at the third level of your journey, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice. 

#### Cutting Words
Also at the third level of your journey, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within sixty feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed. 

#### Additional Magical Secrets 
At the sixth level of your journey, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don't count against the number of bard spells you know. 

#### Peerless Skill 
Starting at the fourteenth level of your journey, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail.
