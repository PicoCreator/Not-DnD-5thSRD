### Spellcasting
- - -
As a vessel of divine might, you can cast spells of the cleric.

#### Cantrips
At the outset of your journey, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. As you progress, you learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spellâ€™s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you complete a long rest.   
You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.   
For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell **_cure wounds_**, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell does not remove it from your list of prepared spells.   
You can alter your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. 

#### Spellcasting Ability 
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your faith in your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 

>**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier 
>**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier 

#### Ritual Casting 
You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. 

#### Spellcasting 
Focus You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. 

### Divine Domain
- - -
Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you select it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.
#### Magickal Spells 
At each level of the cleric, they shall gain a list of magickal spellsâ€”their domain spellsâ€”which they shall always have prepared and shall not count against the number of spells they can prepare each day. Should they have a domain spell that is not on the cleric spell list, it shall still be a cleric spell for them. 

### Channeling Divinity 
- - -
At the second level, they shall gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from their deity, using that energy to fuel magickal effects. They shall start with two such effects: Turning of the Undead and an effect determined by their domain. Some domains shall grant them additional effects as they advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.   
When they use their Channeling Divinity, they shall choose which effect to create. They must then finish a short or long rest to use their Channeling Divinity again. Some Channeling Divinity effects shall require saving throws. When they use such an effect from this class, the DC shall equal their cleric spell save DC.   
Beginning at the sixth level, they can use their Channeling Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at the eighteenth level, they can use it three times between rests. When they finish a short or long rest, they shall regain their expended uses. 

#### Channeling Divinity: Turning of the Undead 
As an action, they shall present their holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear them within 30 feet of them must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it shall be turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.   
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from them as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of them. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

### Enhancing Ability Scores 
- - -
When they reach the fourth level, and again at the eighth, twelfth, sixteenth, and nineteenth level, they can increase one ability score of their choice by 2, or they can increase two ability scores of their choice by 1. As normal, they can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. 

### Destruction of the Undead 
- - -
Starting at the fifth level, when an undead fails its saving throw against their Turning of the Undead feature, the creature shall be instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destruction of the Undead table.

| Cleric Level | Destroys Undead of CR... |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| 5th          | 1/2 or lower             |
| 8th          | 1 or lower               |
| 11th         | 2 or lower               |
| 14th         | 3 or lower               |
| 17th         | 4 or lower               |

### Divine Intercession 
- - -
Beginning at the tenth level, they can call on their deity to intercede on their behalf when their need is great.   
Imploring their deity's aid requires them to use their action. Describe the assistance they seek, and roll percentile dice. If they roll a number equal to or lower than their cleric level, their deity shall intercede. The GM shall choose the nature of the intercession; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.   
If their deity intercedes, they can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, they can use it again after they finish a long rest.   
At the twentieth level, their call for intercession succeeds automatically, no roll required. 

### Life Domain 
- - -
The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy, one of the fundamental forces of the universe, that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and unlife. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).
#### Spells of the Life Domain
| Cleric Level | Spells                                 |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1st          | _bless, cure wounds_                   |
| 3rd          | _lesser restoration, spiritual weapon_ |
| 5th          | _beacon of hope, revivify_             |
| 7th          | _death ward, guardian of faith_        |
| 9th          | _mass cure wounds, raise dead_         |

#### Bonus Proficiency 
When you select this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor. 

#### Disciple of Life 
Beginning at 1st level, your healing spells are more potent. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level. 

#### Channel Divinity: Preserve Life 
From 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the grievously injured.   
As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct. 

#### Blessed Healer 
At 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level. 

#### Divine Strike 
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. 

#### Supreme Healing
From 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.
