## Class Features
As a druid, ye shall gain the following class features.

### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per druid level  
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + thy Constitution modifier  
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + thy Constitution modifier per druid level after 1st
### Proficiencies
**Armour:** Light armour, medium armour, shields (druids shall not don armour or use shields of metal)  
**Weapons:** Clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, spears    
**Tools:** Herbalism kit   
**Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom  
**Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival  

### Equipment
You shall begin with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

* (a) a wooden shield or (b) any simple weapon
* (a) a scimitar or (b) any simple melee weapon
* Leather armour, an explorer's pack, and a druidic focus

### Druidic 
- - -
You are aware of Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can converse in the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic. 

### Spellcasting 
- - -
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.
#### Charms 
At the outset, ye know two charms of thy choosing from the wizard spell list. Ye learn additional wizard charms of thy choosing at higher levels, as shown in the Charms Known column of the Wizard table. 

#### Preparing and Casting Spells 
The Wizard table shows how many spell slots ye have to cast thy spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these wizard spells, ye must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. Ye regain all expended spell slots when thou finish a long rest.   
Thou prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for thee to cast, choosing from the wizard spell list. When thou do so, choose a number of wizard spells equal to thy Intelligence modifier + thy wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which thou have spell slots.   
For example, if thou art a 3rd-level wizard, thou have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, thy list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If thou prepare the 1st-level spell **_heal wounds_**, thou can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from thy list of prepared spells.   
Thou can also change thy list of prepared spells when thou finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on thy list. 

#### Spellcasting Ability 
Intelligence is thy spellcasting ability for thy wizard spells, since thy magic draws upon thy devotion and attunement to nature. Thou use thy Intelligence whenever a spell refers to thy spellcasting ability. In addition, thou use thy Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell thou cast and when making an attack roll with one. 

>**Spell save DC** = 8 + thy proficiency bonus + thy Intelligence modifier 

>**Spell attack modifier** = thy proficiency bonus + thy Intelligence modifier 

#### Ritual Casting 
Thou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and thou have the spell prepared.
#### Spellcasting Focus 
You can employ a druidic focus (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. 

### Wild Shape
- - -
Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.   
Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.

#### Beast Shapes
| Level | Max. CR | Limitations                       | Example     |
|-------|---------|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| 2nd   | 1/4     | No flying or swimming speed       | Wolf        |
| 4th   | 1/2     | No flying speed                   | Crocodile   |
| 8th   | 1       | -                                 | Giant Eagle |

You can remain in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.   
While you are transformed, the following rules apply:  

* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also keep all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them. 
* When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.
* You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as **_call lightning_**, that you've already cast. 
* You keep the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darksight, unless your new form also has that sense.
* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. 

### Druid Circle 
- - -
At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. 

### Ability Score Improvement 
- - -
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't raise an ability score above 20 using this feature.
### Timeless Form
- - -
From the eighteenth level, the primal magicks you wield cause you to age more slowly. For every ten years that pass, your body only ages one year. 

### Beastly Spells
- - -
Beginning at the eighteenth level, you can cast many of your druidic spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druidic spell while in a beastly form, but you are unable to provide material components. 

### Archdruid
- - -
At the twentieth level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druidic spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and are not consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beastly shape from Wild Shape. 

### Circle of the Land
- - -
The Circle of the Land is composed of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magicks are influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites. 

#### Bonus Cantrip
When you choose this circle at the second level, you learn one additional druidic cantrip of your choice. 

#### Natural Recovery
Starting at the second level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be sixth level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.   
For example, when you are a fourth-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a second-level slot or two first-level slots. 

#### Circle Spells
Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At the third, fifth, seventh, and ninth levels you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land - arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp - and consult the associated list of spells.  
Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that does not appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

#### Land’s Stride
Beginning at 6th level, traversing through nonmagical rough terrain costs no additional movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being hindered by them and without taking harm from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.   
Moreover, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell. 

#### Nature's Ward 
When you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease. 

#### Nature's Sanctuary 
When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you. 

>##### Sacred Plants and Wood 
>A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.   
>Likewise, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.   
>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.

>##### Druids and the Gods 
>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse. The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.
