## Class Features
As a druid, you are blessed with the following class features.

### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** A single die of eight sides for each level of druidry  
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 plus your Constitution modifier  
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** A single die of eight sides (or five) plus your Constitution modifier for each level of druidry after the first  

### Proficiencies
**Armour:** Light armour, medium armour, and shields (druids shall not don armour or wield shields of metal)  
**Weapons:** Clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, spears    
**Tools:** Herbalism kit   
**Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom

### Equipment
You shall begin with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

* (a) a wooden shield or (b) any simple weapon
* (a) a scimitar or (b) any simple melee weapon
* Leather armour, an explorer's pack, and a druidic focus

### Druidic 
- - -
You are versed in Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can converse in this language and use it to leave cryptic messages. You and others who know this language can detect such a message without effort. Others may detect the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, yet cannot decipher it without magical aid. 

### Spellcasting 
- - -
Drawing upon the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.

At the outset of their journey, a Druid is gifted with two cantrips of their choosing from the Druidic spell list. As they progress in their studies, they will learn additional cantrips, as indicated in the Druid table.

To cast a Druidic spell of 1st level or higher, the Druid must expend a spell slot of the same level or higher. After a long rest, all expended spell slots are restored.

The Druid must prepare a list of Druidic spells, equal to their Wisdom modifier plus their Druid level (minimum of one spell). These spells must be of a level for which the Druid has spell slots. For example, a 3rd-level Druid with a Wisdom of 16 can prepare six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If the 1st-level spell _Cure Wounds_ is prepared, it can be cast using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell does not remove it from the list of prepared spells.

The Druid's spellcasting ability is Wisdom, as their magic is drawn from their devotion and attunement to nature. Wisdom is used whenever a spell refers to the Druid's spellcasting ability. In addition, Wisdom is used to set the saving throw DC for a Druidic spell and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + Wisdom modifier
Spell attack modifier = proficiency bonus + Wisdom modifier

If a Druidic spell has the ritual tag and is prepared, it can be cast as a ritual.

At the second level of their druidic journey, a spellcaster may use their action to assume the shape of a beast they have seen before. This ability may be used twice, and is regained after a short or long rest. The level of the druid determines the beasts they may transform into, as seen in the Beast Shapes table.

The Beast Shapes table outlines the maximum challenge rating of the beast, as well as any limitations. For example, at the second level, a druid may transform into any beast with a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower, so long as it does not possess a flying or swimming speed.

The druid may remain in their beastly form for a number of hours equal to half their druid level, rounded down. They may revert to their normal form earlier by using a bonus action on their turn, or will automatically revert if they fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While in beast form, the druid's game statistics are replaced by the beast's, but they retain their alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. They also retain all of their skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as the druid and the bonus in its stat block is higher than the druid's, the creature's bonus is used instead.

At the second level of their druidic journey, a spellcaster must also choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon. This choice grants them features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

As they progress in their druidic journey, they may use their Ability Score Improvement feature to increase one ability score of their choice by 2, or two ability scores of their choice by 1. This feature may be used at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, and cannot increase an ability score above 20.

Additionally, a druidic focus (as seen in chapter 5, “Equipment”) may be used as a spellcasting focus for their druid spells.

### Timeless Physique 
- - -
Beginning at 18th level, the ancient magicks that you wield cause you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. 

### Beastly Spells 
- - -
At 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you are unable to provide material components. 

### Archdruid 
- - -
At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an infinite number of times.   
Moreover, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and are not consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape. 

### Circle of the Land
- - -
The Circle of the Land is composed of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites. 

#### Bonus Cantrip 
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. 

#### Natural Recuperation 
Beginning at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.   
For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots. 

#### Circle Spells 
Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land - arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp - and consult the associated list of spells.  
Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that does not appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

#### Land’s Stride
Beginning at 6th level, traversing through nonmagical rough terrain requires no additional movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being hindered by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.   
Moreover, you have an advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell. 

#### Nature's Ward 
When you reach 10th level, you can no longer be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease. 

#### Nature's Sanctuary 
When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you. 

>##### Sacred Plants and Wood 
>A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.   
>Likewise, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.   
>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.

>##### Druids and the Gods 
>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse. The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.
