## Class Features
As a knight, you gain the following class features.

### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d10 per knight level  
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier  
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per knight level after 1st
### Proficiencies
**Armour:** All armour, shields  
**Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons  
**Tools:** None     
**Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma   
**Skills:** Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion and Religion    

### Equipment
You shall begin with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

* (a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons
* (a) five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon
* (a) a priest's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
* Chain mail and a holy symbol

### Divine Sense
- - -
The presence of strong evil is detectable to your senses, like a noisome odour, and powerful good is heard like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you shall know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You shall know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the **_hallow_** spell.   
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you shall regain all expended uses.

### Lay on Hands
- - -
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.   
As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.   
Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.   
This feature has no effect on undead and constructs. 

### Fighting Style 
- - -
At 2nd level, you shall adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You cannot take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
#### Defence 
Whilst wearing armour, thou shalt gain a +1 bonus to thy Armour Class. 

#### Dueling 
When thou art wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, thou shalt gain a +2 bonus to thy damage rolls with that weapon. 

#### Great Weapon Fighting 
When thou rollest a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack thou makest with a melee weapon that thou art wielding with two hands, thou mayest reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for thee to gain this benefit. 

#### Protection 
When a creature thou canst see attacks a target other than thee that is within 5 feet of thee, thou mayest use thy reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. Thou must be wielding a shield. 

### Spellcasting 
- - - 
By 2nd level, thou hast learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric doth. 

#### Preparing and Casting Spells 
The Paladin table showeth how many spell slots thou hast to cast thy spells. To cast one of thy paladin spells of 1st level or higher, thou must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. Thou shalt regain all expended spell slots when thou finish a long rest.   
Thou shalt prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for thee to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When thou dost so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to thy Charisma modifier + half thy paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which thou hast spell slots.    
For example, if thou art a 5th-level paladin, thou hast four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, thy list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If thou preparest the 1st-level spell **_cure wounds_**, thou canst cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd- level slot. Casting the spell doth not remove it from thy list of prepared spells.   
Thou canst change thy list of prepared spells when thou finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requireth time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on thy list.   

#### Spellcasting Ability 
Charisma is thy spellcasting ability for thy paladin spells, since their power derivest from the strength of thy convictions. Thou usest thy Charisma whenever a spell referreth to thy spellcasting ability. In addition, thou usest thy Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell thou castest and when making an attack roll with one. 

> **Spell save DC** = 8 + thy proficiency bonus + thy Charisma modifier 

> **Spell attack modifier** = thy proficiency bonus + thy Charisma modifier 

#### Spellcasting Focus 
Thou canst use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for thy paladin spells. 

### Divine Smite 
- - -
Starting at 2nd level, when thou hittest a creature with a melee weapon attack, thou mayest expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increaseth by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.
### Divine Blessing 
- - -
By 3rd level, the divine power coursing through you renders you immune to disease. 

### Sacred Vow
- - -
When you reach 3rd level, you make the vow that binds you as a paladin for eternity. Until this point you have been in a preparatory stage, devoted to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you select a vow, such as the Vow of Devotion.   
Your selection grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. These features include vow spells and the Channel Divinity feature. 

#### Vow Spells
Each vow has a list of related spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the vow description. Once you gain access to a vow spell, you always have it prepared. Vow spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.    
If you gain a vow spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is still a paladin spell for you. 

#### Channel Divinity
Your vow allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your vow explains how to use it.    
When you use your Channel Divinity, you decide which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.    
Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC. 

### Ability Score Advancement
- - -
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. 

### Extra Attack
- - -
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 

### Aura of Safeguard 
- - -
Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.    
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. 

### Aura of Valor 
- - -
Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious.    
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. 

### Improved Divine Smite
- - -
By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite.
### Cleansing Touch
- - -
Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You shall regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. 

## Sacred Oaths 
Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, a path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class do not consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, a stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.

### Oath of Devotion
- - -
The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the highest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the most stringent standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels--the perfect servants of good--as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms. 

#### Tenets of Devotion 
Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion may vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.    
**Honesty.** Refrain from lying or cheating. Let your word be your bond.    
**Courage.** Never be afraid to act, though prudence is wise.    
**Compassion.** Assist others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.    
**Honor.** Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.    
**Duty.** Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have rightful authority over you.
#### Spell of Oaths
You gain spell of oaths at the knight levels listed.

| Knight Level | Spells                                           |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 3rd          | _protection from evil and good, sanctuary_       |
| 5th          | _lesser restoration, zone of truth_              |
| 9th          | _beacon of hope, dispel magic_                   |
| 13th         | _freedom of movement, guardian of faith_         |
| 17th         | _commune, flame strike_                         |

#### Channel Divinity 
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.    

**Sacred Weapon.** As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.    
You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.    
**Turn the Unholy.** As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.    
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. 

#### Aura of Devotion 
Beginning at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be charmed while you are conscious.    
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. 

#### Spirit of Purity 
From 15th level, you are always under the effects of a **_protection from evil and good_** spell. 

#### Holy Radiance 
At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.    
Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.     
In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.     
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

>##### Breaking Your Oath 
>A knight strives to uphold the highest standards of conduct, yet even the most virtuous knight is fallible. At times the right path may prove too difficult, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a knight to transgress his or her oath. 
>A knight who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another knight of the same order. The knight might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the knight starts anew. 
>If a knight willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM’s discretion, an impenitent knight might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.
