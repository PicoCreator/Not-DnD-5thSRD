## Class Features
As a valiant paladin, you are blessed with the following class features.

### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** A single die of ten sides for each level of paladinhood  
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 plus your Constitution modifier  
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** A die of ten sides (or six) plus your Constitution modifier for each level of paladinhood after the first  

### Proficiencies
**Armour:** All manner of armour and shields  
**Weapons:** Simple and martial weapons alike  
**Tools:** None     
**Saving Throws:** Wisdom and Charisma   
**Skills:** Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion and Religion    

### Equipment
You shall begin your journey with the following equipment, in addition to the items granted by your background:

* (a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons
* (a) five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon
* (a) a priest's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
* Chain mail and a holy symbol

### Divine Sense
- - -
The presence of powerful evil can be felt like a noxious stench, and the power of good can be heard like a heavenly chorus. As an action, you can open your senses to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you shall know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You shall know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you shall also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the **_hallow_** spell.   
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you shall regain all expended uses.

### Lay on Hands
- - -
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.   
As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.   
Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.   
This feature has no effect on undead and constructs. 

### Fighting Style 
- - -
At 2nd level, you shall adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. 

#### Defence
When wearing armor, one is granted a boon of +1 to their Armour Class.

#### Dueling
When wielding a single melee weapon, one is granted a +2 bonus to their damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When one rolls a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack made with a two-handed or versatile weapon, they may reroll the die and must use the new roll.

#### Protection
When a creature within 5 feet of oneself attacks a target other than oneself, one may use their reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, provided they are wielding a shield.

### Spellcasting
- - -
By the second level, one has learned to draw upon divine magic through meditation and prayer, allowing them to cast spells as a cleric does.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Paladin table shows how many spell slots one has to cast their spells. To cast one of their paladin spells of 1st level or higher, one must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. All expended spell slots are regained after a long rest.

One must prepare a list of paladin spells from the paladin spell list, choosing a number of spells equal to their Charisma modifier + half their paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which one has spell slots.

For example, if one is a 5th-level paladin, they have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, their list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If they prepare the 1st-level spell _Cure Wounds_, they can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell does not remove it from their list of prepared spells.

One can change their list of prepared spells after a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on their list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is the spellcasting ability for paladin spells, as their power derives from the strength of one's convictions. Charisma is used whenever a spell refers to one's spellcasting ability. In addition, Charisma is used when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell one casts and when making an attack roll with one.

> **Spell save DC** = 8 + one's proficiency bonus + one's Charisma modifier 

> **Spell attack modifier** = one's proficiency bonus + one's Charisma modifier 

#### Spellcasting Focus
A holy symbol can be used as a spellcasting focus for paladin spells.

### Divine Smite
- - -
Beginning at 2nd level, when one strikes a creature with a melee weapon attack, they may expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.

### Divine Blessing 
- - -
By 3rd level, the divine power that flows through you renders you immune to all manner of maladies. 

### Sacred Vow
- - -
Upon reaching 3rd level, you swear a solemn oath that binds you to the path of the paladin. Until this point, you have been in a preparatory stage, devoted to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now, you must choose an oath, such as the Oath of Devotion. Your selection grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. These features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity ability. 

#### Oath Spells
Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells do not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.    
If you gain an oath spell that does not appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is still considered a paladin spell for you. 

#### Channel Divinity
Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.    
When you use your Channel Divinity, you must choose which option to use. You must then complete a short or long rest before you can use your Channel Divinity again.    
Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC is equal to your paladin spell save DC. 

### Ability Score Enhancement
- - -
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you cannot increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. 

### Extra Attack
- - -
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 

### Aura of Protection 
- - -
Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.    
At 18th level, the range of this aura expands to 30 feet. 

### Aura of Courage 
- - -
Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you cannot be frightened while you are conscious.    
At 18th level, the range of this aura expands to 30 feet. 

### Improved Divine Smite
- - -
By 11th level, you are so imbued with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite. 

### The Cleansing Touch
- - -
Beginning at the 14th level, a hero may use their action to end one spell on themselves or on a willing creature they touch. This power may be used a number of times equal to the hero's Charisma modifier (at least once). After a long rest, the hero regains any expended uses. 

## Sacred Oaths
The path of a paladin is one of righteousness, and involves taking solemn vows to fight wickedness. Upon reaching 3rd level, the final oath is taken, signifying the culmination of the paladin's training. For some, this oath is a formality, while for others it is a true testament to their commitment to justice.

### Oath of Devotion
- - -
The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the highest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. These holy warriors, sometimes referred to as cavaliers or white knights, strive to embody the image of a knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and often expect the same of others. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good, and use their gods' teachings as a measure of their devotion. They look to angels, the perfect servants of good, as their ideals, and often incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms. 

#### Tenets of Devotion 
Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion may vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.    
**Honesty.** Speak truthfully and never deceive. Let your word be your bond.    
**Courage.** Act without fear, but with caution.    
**Compassion.** Aid the helpless, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your enemies, but temper it with wisdom.    
**Honor.** Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.    
**Duty.** Be accountable for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have rightful authority over you.

- - -
From the 14th level onward, a hero may use their action to end one spell on themselves or on a willing creature they touch. This power may be used a number of times equal to the hero's Charisma modifier (at least once). After a long rest, the hero regains any expended uses.

#### Oath Spells 
As you advance in your Paladin levels, you will gain access to powerful oath spells.

| Paladin Level | Spells                                           |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 3rd           | _protection from evil and good, sanctuary_       |
| 5th           | _lesser restoration, zone of truth_              |
| 9th           | _beacon of hope, dispel magic_                   |
| 13th          | _freedom of movement, guardian of faith_         |
| 17th          | _commune, flame strike_                         |

#### Channel Divinity 
Upon taking this oath at 3rd level, you will be granted two Channel Divinity options.    

**Sacred Weapon.** As an action, you can bless one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits a brilliant light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it will become so for the duration.    
You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect will end.    
**Turn the Unholy.** As an action, you can present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of censure to fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it will be turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.    
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it cannot willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also cannot take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there is nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. 

#### Aura of Devotion 
Beginning at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you will be immune to charm while you are conscious.    
At 18th level, the range of this aura will increase to 30 feet. 

#### Purity of Spirit 
Starting at 15th level, you will be constantly under the effects of a **_protection from evil and good_** spell. 

#### Holy Nimbus 
At 20th level, as an action, you can radiate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, a brilliant light will shine from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light will shine 30 feet beyond that.    
Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature will take 10 radiant damage.     
In addition, for the duration, you will have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.     
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

>##### Breaking Your Oath 
>A Paladin strives to uphold the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous Paladin is not infallible. Sometimes the right path proves too difficult, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a Paladin to transgress their oath. 
>A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares their faith or from another Paladin of the same order. The Paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the Paladin can start anew. 
>If a Paladin willfully violates their oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be dire. At the GM’s discretion, an unrepentant Paladin might be forced to abandon this class and take up another.
