* (a) scale mail or (b) leather armour
* (a) two shortswords or (b) two simple melee weapons 
* (a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
* A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows

### Favoured Enemy
- - -
From the moment you set foot upon your path, you have had extensive experience in studying, tracking, hunting, and even conversing with a certain type of foe.    
Choose a type of favoured enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favoured enemies.    
You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favoured enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.     
When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favoured enemies, if they speak one at all.     
You choose one additional favoured enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you ascend in power, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures. 

### Natural Explorer
- - -
You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at travelling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favoured terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favoured terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're proficient in.    
Whilst journeying for an hour or more in your favoured terrain, you shall gain the following benefits:

* Difficult terrain shall not impede your group's progress. 
* Your group cannot become lost except by magical means.
* Even when you are engaged in another activity whilst travelling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you shall remain vigilant to danger.
* If you are travelling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
* When you forage, you shall find twice as much sustenance as you normally would.
* Whilst tracking other creatures, you shall also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area. 

You choose additional favoured terrain types at 6th and 10th level. 

### Martial Arts
- - -
At the second tier of your training, you must choose a particular style of combat to specialize in. Select one of the following options. You may not select the same style twice, even if you are given the opportunity to do so later. 

#### Archery 
You are granted a +2 bonus to all attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. 

#### Defense 
When wearing armor, you are granted a +1 bonus to your Armor Class. 

#### Dueling 
When you are wielding a single melee weapon and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. 

#### Two-Weapon Fighting 
When engaging in two-weapon fighting, you may add your ability modifier to the damage of your second attack. 

### Spellcasting 
- - -
By the time you reach the second tier of your training, you have learned to tap into the magical power of nature to cast spells, much like a druid. 

#### Spell Slots 
The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the same level or higher. After a long rest, all expended spell slots are restored.     
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell **_animal friendship_** and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast **_animal friendship_** using either slot. 

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher 
You are familiar with two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.   
The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.    
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 

At the third level of their journey, a Ranger must choose an Archetype to emulate: the Hunter or the Beast Master. Both of these paths grant the Ranger special abilities at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

The Ranger's spellcasting ability is Wisdom, as their magic is drawn from their attunement to nature. When casting a spell, the Ranger's Spell Save DC is 8 plus their Proficiency Bonus and Wisdom modifier. When making an attack roll with a spell, the Ranger's Spell Attack modifier is their Proficiency Bonus plus their Wisdom modifier.

At 3rd level, the Ranger gains the ability to sense the presence of aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead within a mile of their location (or up to 6 miles if they are in their favored terrain).

At 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, the Ranger can increase one or two of their Ability Scores by 2 or 1, respectively.

At 5th level, the Ranger gains the ability to make two attacks when they take the Attack action on their turn.

At 8th level, the Ranger can move through nonmagical difficult terrain without expending extra movement, and they have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement.

At 10th level, the Ranger can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for themselves, granting them a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as they remain still.

At 14th level, the Ranger can use the Hide action as a bonus action on their turn, and they cannot be tracked by nonmagical means unless they choose to leave a trail.

### Feral Instincts 
- - -
At 18th level, you gain a supernatural sense that aids you in combatting foes you cannot see. When you attack a creature you cannot perceive, your lack of sight does not impose a disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. Furthermore, you are aware of the whereabouts of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature is not hidden from you and you are not deafened or blinded. 

### Foe's Bane
- - -
At 20th level, you become a masterful hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied. 

## Ranger Archetypes 

The ideal of the ranger has two classic expressions: the Hunter and the Beast Master. 

### Hunter
- - -
Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you tread the Hunter's path, you learn specialized techniques for combating the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and fearsome dragons. 

#### Hunter's Prey 
At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

**Colossus Slayer.** Your tenacity can wear down even the mightiest of foes. When you strike a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an additional 1d8 damage if it is below its hit point maximum. You can only deal this extra damage once per turn.    
**Giant Killer.** When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.     
**Horde Breaker.** Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon. 

#### Defensive Tactics 
At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.    

**Flee the Horde.** Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.    
**Multiattack Defense.** When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the remainder of the turn.    
**Iron Will.** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. 

#### Multiattack 
At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice. 

**Volley.** You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon's range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.    
**Whirlwind Attack.** You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. 

#### Superior Hunter's Defense 
At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice. 

**Evasion.** When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.    
**Stand Against the Tide.** When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to compel that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.    
**Uncanny Dodge.** When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.
