### Favored Enemy
- - -
From the first level, you have gained much experience in studying, tracking, hunting, and even conversing with a certain type of foe.    
Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.    
You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.     
When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.     
You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your travels. 

### Natural Explorer
- - -
You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at travelling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favoured terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favoured terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're proficient in.    
Whilst travelling for an hour or more in your favoured terrain, you gain the following benefits:

* Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel. 
* Your group can't become lost except by magical means.
* Even when you are engaged in another activity while travelling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
* If you are travelling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
* When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
* While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area. 

You choose additional favoured terrain types at 6th and 10th level.
### Combat Manner
- - -
At the second degree, thou shalt adopt a particular manner of combat as thy specialty. Choose one of the following options. Thou canst not take a Combat Manner option more than once, even if thou later get to choose again. 

#### Archery 
Thou gainest a +2 bonus to attack rolls thou makest with ranged weapons. 

#### Defence 
Whilst thou art wearing armor, thou gainest a +1 bonus to AC. 

#### Dueling 
When thou art wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, thou gainest a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. 

#### Two-Weapon Fighting 
When thou engagest in two-weapon fighting, thou canst add thy ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. 

### Spellcasting 
- - -
By the time thou reach 2nd degree, thou hast learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid doth. 

#### Spell Slots 
The Ranger table showeth how many spell slots thou hast to cast thy spells of 1st degree and higher. To cast one of these spells, thou must expend a slot of the spell's degree or higher. Thou regainest all expended spell slots when thou finish a long rest.     
For example, if thou knowest the 1st-degree spell **_animal friendship_** and hast a 1st-degree and a 2nd-degree spell slot available, thou canst cast **_animal friendship_** using either slot. 

#### Spells Known of 1st Degree and Higher 
Thou knowest two 1st-degree spells of thy choice from the ranger spell list.   
The Spells Known column of the Ranger table showeth when thou learnest more ranger spells of thy choice. Each of these spells must be of a degree for which thou hast spell slots. For instance, when thou reach 5th degree in this class, thou canst learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd degree.    
Additionally, when thou gain a degree in this class, thou canst choose one of the ranger spells thou knowest and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a degree for which thou hast spell slots.
#### Spellcasting Ability 
Wisdom is your spellcasting aptitude for your ranger spells, since your sorcery draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 

> **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier 
> **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Ranger Archetype 
- - -
At 3rd level, you select an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level. 

### Primeval Awareness
- - -
Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number. 

### Ability Score Improvement 
- - -
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. 

### Extra Attack 
- - -
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 

### Land's Stride
- - -
Starting at 8th level, traversing through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.    
In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell. 

### Hide in Plain Sight 
- - -
Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.    
Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit. 

### Vanish
- - -
Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.
### Feral Instincts
- - -
At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that aid you in combat against creatures you cannot see. When you attack a creature you cannot see, your lack of sight does not impose disadvantage on your attack rolls. 
You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature is not hidden from you and you are not blinded or deafened. 

### Foe Slayer
- - -
At 20th level, you become a master hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied. 

## Ranger Archetypes 

The ideal of the ranger has two classic expressions: the Hunter and the Beast Master. 

### Hunter
- - -
Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wild. As you walk the Hunter's path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and fearsome dragons. 

#### Hunter's Prey 
At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.
