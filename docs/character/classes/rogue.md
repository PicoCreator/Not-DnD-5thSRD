### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per character level  
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + Constitution modifier  
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + Constitution modifier per character level after 1st

**Skills:** Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth  

### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

* (a) a rapier or (b) a shortsword 
* (a) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a shortsword
* (a) a burglar's pack, (b) a dungeoneer's pack, or (c) an explorer's pack
* (a) Leather armor, two daggers, and lockpicks
### Mastery 
- - -
At the outset, select two of your aptitudes, or one of your aptitudes and your skill with thievery tools. Your aptitude bonus is doubled for any capacity check you make that utilizes either of the chosen aptitudes.   
At 6th level, you can pick two more of your aptitudes (in aptitudes or with thievery tools) to acquire this advantage. 

### Stealthy Strike 
- - -
Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have the upper hand on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.    
You don't need the upper hand on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.    
The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Stealthy Strike column of the Rogue table. 

### Thievery Cant 
- - -
During your rogue training you learned thievery cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thievery cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.    
In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thievery guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for rogues on the run. 

### Nimble Action 
- - -
Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. 

### Roguish Archetype
- - -
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. 

### Ability Score Improvement 
- - -
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. 

### Uncanny Avoidance 
- - -
Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.
### Evasion 
- - -
From the 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an **_ice storm_** spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. 

### Reliable Talent 
- - -
By the 11th level, you have perfected your chosen skills. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. 

### Blindsense 
- - -
From the 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you. 

### Slippery Mind 
- - -
By the 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. 

### Elusive 
From the 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated. 

### Stroke of Luck 
- - -
At the 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.   
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. 

## Roguish Archetypes 
Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on honing their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus - not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques. 

### Thief 
- - -
You refine your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn't employ. 

#### Fast Hands 
From the 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action. 

#### Second-Story Work 
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.    
In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier. 

#### Supreme Sneak 
From the 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn. 

#### Use Magic Device 
By the 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items. 

#### Thief's Reflexes 
When you reach the 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.
