The Rogue

* (a) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a shortsword
* (a) a burglar's pack, (b) a dungeoneer's pack, or (c) an explorer's pack

### Expertise 
- - -
At the outset of your journey, you may select two of your proficiencies, or one of your proficiencies and your aptitude with thieving tools, to be doubled in their effectiveness. When you reach the sixth level of your journey, you may select two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieving tools) to gain this benefit. 

### Sneak Attack 
- - -
From the very beginning of your journey, you have been taught the art of striking subtly and exploiting a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you may deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have the advantage on the attack roll. This attack must be made with a finesse or a ranged weapon. You do not need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within five feet of it, that enemy is not incapacitated, and you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. The amount of the extra damage increases as you progress in your journey, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table. 

### Thieves' Cant 
- - -
During your training as a rogue, you have learned the secret language of thieves' cant, a mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant can understand such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run. 

### Cunning Action 
- - -
As you progress in your journey, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You may take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. 

### Roguish Archetype
- - -
At the third level of your journey, you may choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at the third level and then again at the ninth, thirteenth, and seventeenth level. 

### Ability Score Improvement 
- - -
As you progress in your journey, when you reach the fourth level and again at the eighth, tenth, twelfth, sixteenth, and nineteenth level, you may increase one ability score of your choice by two, or you may increase two ability scores of your choice by one. As normal, you cannot increase an ability score above twenty using this feature. 

### Uncanny Dodge 
- - -
When you reach the fifth level of your journey, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you may use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you. 

### Evasion 
- - -
From the seventh level of experience, you can nimbly dodge away from certain area effects, such as the fiery breath of a red dragon or the chill of an **_ice storm_** spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you shall take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. 

### Reliable Talent 
- - -
By the eleventh level, you have honed your chosen skills to near perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that allows you to add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. 

### Blindsense 
- - -
Beginning at the fourteenth level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you. 

### Slippery Mind 
- - -
By the fifteenth level, you have acquired greater mental fortitude. You are now proficient in Wisdom saving throws. 

### Elusive 
From the eighteenth level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you are not incapacitated. 

### Stroke of Luck 
- - -
At the twentieth level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.   
Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you have completed a short or long rest. 

## Roguish Archetypes 
Rogues share many traits, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus - not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques. 

### Thief 
- - -
You have honed your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn't employ. 

#### Fast Hands 
Beginning at the third level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action. 

#### Second-Story Work 
When you choose this archetype at the third level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.    
In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier. 

#### Supreme Sneak 
Starting at the ninth level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn. 

#### Use Magic Device 
By the thirteenth level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items. 

#### Thief's Reflexes 
When you reach the seventeenth level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You cannot use this feature when you are surprised.
