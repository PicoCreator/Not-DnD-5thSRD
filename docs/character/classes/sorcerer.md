A moment in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This source of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. 

#### Cantrips 
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.
#### Spell Slots 
The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.     
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell **_burning hands_** and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast **_burning hands_** using either slot. 

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher 
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.    
The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.     
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 

#### Spellcasting Ability 
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 

> **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier 

> **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

#### Careful Enchantment 
When thou castest an enchantment that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, thou can protect some of those creatures from the enchantment's full force. To do so, thou spendest 1 sorcery point and choosest a number of those creatures up to thy Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeedeth on its saving throw against the enchantment. 

#### Distant Enchantment 
When thou castest an enchantment that hath a range of 5 feet or greater, thou can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the enchantment.   
When thou castest an enchantment that hath a range of touch, thou can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the enchantment 30 feet. 

#### Empowered Enchantment 
When thou rollest damage for an enchantment, thou can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to thy Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Thou must use the new rolls.   
Thou can use Empowered Enchantment even if thou hast already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the enchantment. 

#### Extended Enchantment 
When thou castest an enchantment that hath a duration of 1 minute or longer, thou can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours. 

#### Heightened Enchantment 
When thou castest an enchantment that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, thou can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the enchantment disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the enchantment. 

#### Quickened Enchantment 
When thou castest an enchantment that hath a casting time of 1 action, thou can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting. 

#### Subtle Enchantment 
When thou castest an enchantment, thou can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components. 

#### Twinned Enchantment 
When thou castest an enchantment that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, thou can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the enchantment's level to target a second creature in range with the same enchantment (1 sorcery point if the enchantment is a cantrip).    
To be eligible, an enchantment must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the enchantment's current level. For example, **_magic missile_** and **_scorching ray_** aren't eligible, but **_ray of frost_** and **_chromatic orb_** are. 

### Ability Score Improvement

When thou reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, thou can increase one ability score of thy choice by 2, or thou can increase two ability scores of thy choice by 1. As normal, thou can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. 

### Sorcerous Restoration 
- - -
At 20th level, thou regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever thou finish a short rest. 

## Sorcerous Origins 
Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic bloodline and wild magic. 

### Draconic Bloodline
- - -
Thy innate magic cometh from draconic magic that was mingled with thy blood or that of thy ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.

#### Dragon Ancestor 
At 1st level, thou choosest one type of dragon as thy ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features thou gain later.

| Dragon | Damage Type |
|--------|-------------|
| Black  | Acid        |
| Blue   | Lightning   |
| Brass  | Fire        |
| Bronze | Lightning   |
| Copper | Acid        |
| Gold   | Fire        |
| Green  | Poison      |
| Red    | Fire        |
| Silver | Cold        |
| White  | Cold        |

Thou canst speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever thou makest a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, thy proficiency bonus is doubled if it applieth to the check. 

#### Draconic Resilience 
As magic floweth through thy body, it causeth physical traits of thy dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, thy hit point maximum increaseth by 1 and increaseth by 1 again whenever thou gain a level in this class.    
Additionally, parts of thy skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When thou art not wearing armor, thy AC equaleth 13 + thy Dexterity modifier. 

#### Elemental Affinity 
Starting at 6th level, when thou castest an enchantment that dealeth damage of the type associated with thy draconic ancestry, thou can add thy Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that enchantment. At the same time, thou can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour. 

#### Dragon Wings
At 14th level, thou gainest the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from thy back, gaining a flying speed equal to thy current speed. Thou canst create these wings as a bonus action on thy turn. They last until thou dismissest them as a bonus action on thy turn.    
Thou canst not manifest thy wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate thy wings might be destroyed when thou manifestest them. 

#### Draconic Presence 
Beginning at 18th level, thou can channel the dread presence of thy dragon ancestor, causing those around thee to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, thou can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (thy choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until thou losest thy concentration (as if thou wert casting a concentration enchantment), each hostile creature that starteth its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if thou chosest awe) or frightened (if thou chosest fear) until the aura endeth. A creature that succeedeth on this saving throw is immune to thy aura for 24 hours.
