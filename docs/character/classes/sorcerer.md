At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell **_burning hands_** and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast **_burning hands_** using either slot.

You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

- - -
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.    
You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted. 

#### Careful Spellcasting 
When you cast a spell that requires other creatures to make a saving throw, you may protect some of those creatures from the full force of the spell. To do so, expend one sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). Any chosen creature will automatically succeed on its saving throw against the spell. 

#### Distant Spellcasting 
When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you may expend one sorcery point to double the range of the spell. When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you may expend one sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet. 

#### Empowered Spellcasting 
When you roll damage for a spell, you may expend one sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. You may use Empowered Spellcasting even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell. 

#### Extended Spellcasting 
When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you may expend one sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours. 

#### Heightened Spellcasting 
When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you may expend three sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell. 

#### Quickened Spellcasting 
When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you may expend two sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting. 

#### Subtle Spellcasting 
When you cast a spell, you may expend one sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components. 

#### Twinned Spellcasting 
When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you may expend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (one sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip). To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. For example, **_magic missile_** and **_scorching ray_** are not eligible, but **_ray of frost_** and **_chromatic orb_** are. 

### Ability Score Improvement 
- - -
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you may increase one ability score of your choice by two, or you may increase two ability scores of your choice by one. As normal, you may not increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. 

### Sorcerous Restoration 
- - -
At 20th level, you regain four expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest. 

## Sorcerous Origins 
Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic bloodline and wild magic. 

### Draconic Bloodline
- - -
Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.

#### Dragon Ancestor 
At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.

| Dragon | Damage Type |
|--------|-------------|
| Black  | Acid        |
| Blue   | Lightning   |
| Brass  | Fire        |
| Bronze | Lightning   |
| Copper | Acid        |
| Gold   | Fire        |
| Green  | Poison      |
| Red    | Fire        |
| Silver | Cold        |
| White  | Cold        |

You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check. 

#### Draconic Resilience 
As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by one and increases by one again whenever you gain a level in this class.    
Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals thirteen plus your Dexterity modifier. 

#### Elemental Affinity 
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you may add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you may expend one sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for one hour. 

#### Dragon Wings
At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, granting you a flying speed equal to your current speed. You may create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.    
You may not manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them. 

#### Draconic Presence 
Beginning at 18th level, you may channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you may expend five sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of sixty feet. For one minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for twenty-four hours.
