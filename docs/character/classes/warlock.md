**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + Constitution modifier per character level after 1st  

### Proficiencies

**Weapons:** Simple weapons    
**Tools:** None   
**Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma     
**Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, and Religion

* (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
* (a) a scholar's pack or (b) a dungeoneer's pack
* Leather armour, any simple weapon, and two daggers

### Otherworldly Patron 
- - -
At 1st level, you have made a pact with an otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your selection grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
### Spellcraft of the Arcane 
- - -
Your diligent research and the magicks bestowed upon you by your benefactor have granted you the ability to cast spells. 

#### Cantrips 
You are aware of two cantrips of your choosing from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as indicated in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

#### Spell Slots 
The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you possess. The table also shows the level of those slots; all of your spell slots are of the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you complete a short or long rest.    
For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell **_thunderwave_**, you must expend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. 

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher 
At 1st level, you are aware of two 1st-level spells of your choosing from the warlock spell list.    
The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what is indicated in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.     
In addition, when you gain a level in this class, you can select one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 

#### Spellcasting Ability 
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 

>**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier 

>**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier 

#### Spellcasting Focus 
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. 

### Eldritch Invocations 
- - -
Through your studies of occult lore, you have uncovered eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that grant you a lasting magical ability.    
At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as indicated in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.     
In addition, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level. 

### Pact Boon 
- - -
At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you in recognition of your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.
#### Bond of the Chain 
Ye learn the **_find familiar_** spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against yer number of spells known.    
When ye cast the spell, ye can choose one of the normal forms for yer familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.    
Additionally, when ye take the Attack action, ye can forgo one of yer own attacks to allow yer familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction. 

#### Bond of the Blade 
Ye can use yer action to create a pact weapon in yer empty hand. Ye can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time ye create it. Ye are proficient with it while ye wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.     
Yer pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from ye for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if ye use this feature again, if ye dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if ye die.     
Ye can transform one magic weapon into yer pact weapon by performing a special ritual while ye hold the weapon. Ye perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. Ye can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever ye create yer pact weapon thereafter. Ye can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being yer pact weapon if ye die, if ye perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if ye use a 1-hour ritual to break yer bond to it. The weapon appears at yer feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks. 

#### Bond of the Tome 
Yer patron gives ye a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When ye gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on yer person, ye can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against yer number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for ye.    
If ye lose yer Book of Shadows, ye can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from yer patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when ye die. 

### Ability Score Improvement
- - -
When ye reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, ye can increase one ability score of yer choice by 2, or ye can increase two ability scores of yer choice by 1. As normal, ye can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. 

### Mystic Arcanum 
- - -
At 11th level, yer patron bestows upon ye a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th- level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.    
Ye can cast yer arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. Ye must finish a long rest before ye can do so again.    
At higher levels, ye gain more warlock spells of yer choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th- level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. Ye regain all uses of yer Mystic Arcanum when ye finish a long rest. 

### Eldritch Master 
- - -
At 20th level, ye can draw on yer inner reserve of mystical power while entreating yer patron to regain expended spell slots. Ye can spend 1 minute entreating yer patron for aid to regain all yer expended spell slots from yer Bond Magic feature. Once ye regain spell slots with this feature, ye must finish a long rest before ye can do so again.

## Eldritch Invocations 
If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, ye must meet them to learn it. Ye can learn the invocation at the same time that ye meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to yer level in this class. 

#### Agonizing Blast 
**Prerequisite:** **_eldritch blast_** cantrip 

When ye cast eldritch blast, add yer Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit. 

#### Armor of Shadows 
Ye can cast **_mage armor_** on yerself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. 

#### Ascendant Step 
**Prerequisite:** 9th level

#### Beguiling Influence

#### Bewitching Whispers 
**Prerequisite:** 7th level 

Ye can cast **_compulsion_** once using a warlock spell slot. Ye can't do so again until ye finish a long rest. 

#### Book of Ancient Secrets 
**Prerequisite: Bond of the Tome feature** 
Ye can now inscribe magical rituals in yer Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list (the two needn't be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells ye know. With yer Book of Shadows in hand, ye can cast the chosen spells as rituals. Ye can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless ye've learned them by some other means. Ye can also cast a warlock spell ye know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.    
On yer adventures, ye can add other ritual spells to yer Book of Shadows. When ye find such a spell, ye can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half yer warlock level (rounded up) and if ye can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it. 

#### Chains of Carceri 
**Prerequisite:** 15th level, Bond of the Chain feature

Ye can cast **_hold monster_** at will—targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental - without expending a spell slot or material components. Ye must finish a long rest before ye can use this invocation on the same creature again.

#### Gaze of Two Souls 
You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same realm of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.

## Otherworldly Patrons 
The patrons of warlocks are powerful entities from other realms of existence, not gods, but almost godlike in their power. These patrons grant their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect a great deal in return. 
Some patrons are generous with their knowledge, while others are more reluctant and may only make a pact with one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron may view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals. 

### The Fiend
- - -
You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower realms of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against them. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz'Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths. 

#### Expanded Spell List 
The Fiend allows you to choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| Spell Level | Spells                              |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1st         | _burning hands, command_            |
| 2nd         | _blindness/deafness, scorching ray_ |
| 3rd         | _fireball, stinking cloud_          |
| 4th         | _fire shield, wall of fire_         |
| 5th         | _flame strike, hallow_              |

#### Blessing of the Dark One 
Beginning at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1). 

#### Fortune of the Dark One 
Beginning at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.     
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest. 

#### Resilience of the Fiend 
Beginning at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance. 

#### Hurl Through Hell 
Beginning at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower realms. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.     
At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.     
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest. 

>#### Your Pact Boon 
>Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron's nature.    
>**Pact of the Chain.** Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One's nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.    
>**Pact of the Blade.** If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.    
>**Pact of the Tome.** Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.   
```

#### Witch-Seeing 
**Requirement:** 15th level and above, and you can perceive the true form of any shape-shifter or creature that is hidden by illusion or transmutation magic, so long as it is within 30 feet of you and in your line of sight.

#### Blessing of the Dark One 
Beginning at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1). 

#### Fortune of the Dark One 
Beginning at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.     
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest. 

#### Resilience of the Fiend 
Beginning at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance. 

#### Hurl Through Hell 
Beginning at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower realms. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.     
At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.     
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest. 

>#### Your Pact Boon 
>Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron's nature.    
>**Pact of the Chain.** Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One's nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.    
>**Pact of the Blade.** If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.    
>**Pact of the Tome.** Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.
