### Proficiencies

**Weapons:** Simple weapons    
**Tools:** None   
**Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma     
**Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, and Religion   

### Equipment
You begin your journey with the following equipment, in addition to the items granted by your background:
* (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon
* (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
* (a) a scholar's pack or (b) a dungeoneer's pack
* Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers

### Otherworldly Patron 
- - -
At the commencement of your journey, you have made a pact with a mysterious being of your choosing: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your selection grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. 

### The Art of Pact Magic 
- - -
Through your diligent arcane research and the magical gifts bestowed upon you by your patron, you have gained a facility with spells. 

#### Cantrips 
You are privy to two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. As you progress in your studies, you will learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice, as indicated in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

#### Spell Slots 
The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you possess. The table also indicates the level of those slots; all of your spell slots are of the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. After a short or long rest, you will regain all expended spell slots.    
For example, when you reach 5th level, you will have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell **_thunderwave_**, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. 

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher 
At 1st level, you are aware of two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.    
The Spells Known column of the Warlock table indicates when you will learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what is shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for instance, you will learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.     
Furthermore, when you gain a level in this class, you can select one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which must also be of a level for which you have spell slots. 

#### Spellcasting Ability 
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. 

>**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier 

>**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier 

#### Spellcasting Focus 
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. 

### Eldritch Invocations 
- - -
Through your exploration of occult lore, you have uncovered eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that grant you an enduring magical ability.    
At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. As you advance in your warlock levels, you will gain additional invocations of your choice, as indicated in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.     
Moreover, when you gain a level in this class, you can select one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level. 

### Pact Boon 
- - -
At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a blessing upon you in recognition of your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice. 

#### The Pact of the Chain 
Thou shalt learn the **_find familiar_** spell and cast it as a ritual. This spell shall not count against thy number of spells known. 
When thou castest the spell, thou canst choose one of the normal forms for thy familiar or one of the special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite. 
Moreover, when thou takest the Attack action, thou canst forgo one of thy own attacks to allow thy familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction. 

#### The Pact of the Blade 
Thou canst use thy action to create a pact weapon in thy empty hand. Thou canst choose the form that this melee weapon taketh each time thou createst it. Thou art proficient with it while thou wieldest it. This weapon shall count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. 
Thy pact weapon shall disappear if it is more than 5 feet away from thee for 1 minute or more. It shall also disappear if thou usest this feature again, if thou dismisseth the weapon (no action required), or if thou diest. 
Thou canst transform one magic weapon into thy pact weapon by performing a special ritual while thou holdest the weapon. Thou performest the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. Thou canst then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it shall appear whenever thou createst thy pact weapon thereafter. Thou canst not affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon shall cease being thy pact weapon if thou diest, if thou performest the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if thou usest a 1-hour ritual to break thy bond to it. The weapon shall appear at thy feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaketh. 

#### The Pact of the Tome 
Thy patron shall give thee a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When thou gainest this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three need not be from the same list). While the book is on thy person, thou canst cast those cantrips at will. They shall not count against thy number of cantrips known. If they do not appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for thee. 
If thou losest thy Book of Shadows, thou canst perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from thy patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it shall destroy the previous book. The book shall turn to ash when thou diest. 

### Ability Score Improvement
- - -
When thou reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, thou canst increase one ability score of thy choice by 2, or thou canst increase two ability scores of thy choice by 1. As normal, thou canst not increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. 

### Mystic Arcanum 
- - -
At 11th level, thy patron bestoweth upon thee a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th- level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum. 
Thou canst cast thy arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. Thou must finish a long rest before thou canst do so again. 
At higher levels, thou gainest more warlock spells of thy choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th- level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. Thou regainest all uses of thy Mystic Arcanum when thou finish a long rest. 

### Eldritch Master 
- - -
At 20th level, thou canst draw on thy inner reserve of mystical power while entreating thy patron to regain expended spell slots. Thou canst spend 1 minute entreating thy patron for aid to regain all thy expended spell slots from thy Pact Magic feature. Once thou regainest spell slots with this feature, thou must finish a long rest before thou canst do so again.

## Eldritch Invocations 
If an eldritch invocation hath prerequisites, thou must meet them to learn it. Thou canst learn the invocation at the same time that thou meeteth its prerequisites. A level prerequisite referreth to thy level in this class. 

#### Agonizing Blast 
**Prerequisite:** **_eldritch blast_** cantrip 

When thou castest eldritch blast, add thy Charisma modifier to the damage it dealeth on a hit.

#### Book of Ancient Secrets 
**Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature** 
Thou canst now inscribe magical rituals in thy Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list (the two need not be from the same list). The spells shall appear in the book and shall not count against the number of spells thou knowest. With thy Book of Shadows in hand, thou canst cast the chosen spells as rituals. Thou canst not cast the spells except as rituals, unless thou hast learned them by some other means. Thou canst also cast a warlock spell thou knowest as a ritual if it hath the ritual tag. 
On thy adventures, thou canst add other ritual spells to thy Book of Shadows. When thou findeth such a spell, thou canst add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half thy warlock level (rounded up) and if thou canst spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process taketh 2 hours and costeth 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it. 

#### Chains of Carceri 
**Prerequisite:** 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature

#### Gaze of Two Souls 
You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are unable to perceive your own surroundings.

## Otherworldly Patrons 
The powerful entities that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods, but are almost godlike in their might. These patrons grant their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.   
Some patrons are generous with their knowledge, while others are more reluctant to bestow their power. Warlocks who serve the same patron may view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals. 

### The Fiend
- - -
You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz'Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths. 

#### Expanded Spell List 
The Fiend allows you to choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| Spell Level | Spells                              |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1st         | _burning hands, command_            |
| 2nd         | _blindness/deafness, scorching ray_ |
| 3rd         | _fireball, stinking cloud_          |
| 4th         | _fire shield, wall of fire_         |
| 5th         | _flame strike, hallow_              |

#### Dark One's Blessing 
Beginning at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1). 

#### Dark One's Own Luck 
Beginning at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.     
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. 

#### Fiendish Resilience 
Beginning at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance. 

#### Hurl Through Hell 
Beginning at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.     
At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.     
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. 

>#### Your Pact Boon 
>Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron's nature.    
>**Pact of the Chain.** Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One's nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.    
>**Pact of the Blade.** If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.    
>**Pact of the Tome.** Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.   

```
#### Witch Sight 
**Prerequisite:** 15th level You can discern the true form of any shapechanger or creature concealed by illusion or transmutation magic while the creature is within 30 feet of you and within line of sight.

You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz'Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths. 

#### Expanded Spell List 
The Fiend allows you to choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| Spell Level | Spells                              |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1st         | _burning hands, command_            |
| 2nd         | _blindness/deafness, scorching ray_ |
| 3rd         | _fireball, stinking cloud_          |
| 4th         | _fire shield, wall of fire_         |
| 5th         | _flame strike, hallow_              |

#### Dark One's Blessing 
Beginning at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1). 

#### Dark One's Own Luck 
Beginning at 6th level, you can call upon your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.     
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. 

#### Fiendish Resilience 
Beginning at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance. 

#### Hurl Through Hell 
Beginning at 14th level, when you strike a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.     
At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.     
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. 

>#### Your Pact Boon 
>Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron's nature.    
>**Pact of the Chain.** Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One's nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.    
>**Pact of the Blade.** If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade ensnared in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.    
>**Pact of the Tome.** Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.
