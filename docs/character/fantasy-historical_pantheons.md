# The Pantheons of Yore
The gods of old have been around since the dawn of time, and their presence can be felt in every corner of the world. From the Celtic gods of the wild, to the Greek gods of Olympus, to the Egyptian gods of the afterlife, these pantheons have been a source of awe and inspiration for generations.

The Celtic gods are closely aligned with the forces of nature, and are often served by druids as well as clerics. The gods of Olympus make their presence known through the thunder and the waves, and have a place in the human heart. The Egyptian pantheon is unique in having three gods responsible for death, each with different alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, Set is a chaotic evil god of murder, and Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning.

These gods of yore have been a source of strength and guidance for many, and their power is still felt in the world today.

## The Ancient Pantheon
In a realm of rolling hills and deep valleys, where the sun sets in a blaze of glory and the stars twinkle in the night sky, lies the home of the Ancient Pantheon. Here, the gods and goddesses of old have been worshipped for centuries, their power and influence stretching far and wide. From the depths of the sea to the highest peaks of the mountains, their presence is felt in every corner of the land.

The Ancient Pantheon is made up of two main families, the Olympians (deities of strength and courage) and the Titans (gods of wisdom and knowledge). Once bitter rivals, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Typhon and Echidna).
