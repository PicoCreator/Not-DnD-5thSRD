# Fantasy-Historical Pantheons 
The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fables of bygone religions from our world's ancient times. They include deities that are most suitable for use in a game, removed from their historical context in the real world and combined into pantheons that serve the needs of the game. 

## The Celtic Pantheon 
It is said that something wild resides in the depths of every soul, a place that thrills to the sound of geese calling in the night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak--and it is in this place that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the brook and stream, their power augmented by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared give a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.

The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely connected with the forces of nature that druids revere. 

## The Greek Pantheon 
The gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lapping of waves against the shores and the roar of the thunder among the cloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the dry, olive-covered hillsides bear witness to their presence. Every aspect of nature reverberates with their presence, and they've made a place for themselves inside the human heart, too. 

## The Egyptian Pantheon 
These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, inheritors of the rulership of the cosmos and the maintenance of the divine principle of Ma'at--the fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and women in their rightful place in the universe.

The Egyptian pantheon is unique in having three gods responsible for death, each with different alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for slaying his brother Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning.
## The Ancient Pantheon
Where the land rises from the verdant meadows into the rolling hills, where the caravans draw up on to the road, where the rivers flow forward and retreat with every season--this is the land of the Ancients, the home of the Ancient pantheon. It's a bountiful clime, and one that calls for peaceful living. The people of the land have had to adapt to the changing conditions in order to thrive, but they haven't been too changed by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of trade for goods and wealth, it's remarkable the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these people had for strong leadership and wise action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the whisper of the wind and the rustling of the trees, and smell them in the smoke of a campfire.

The Ancient pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of justice and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once rivals, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the monsters (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).
