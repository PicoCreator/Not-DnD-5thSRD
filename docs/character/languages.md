Description: Rules and information for different languages from the 5th Edition (5e) SRD (System Reference Document).

# Tongues
Your race will determine the languages your character can speak by default, and your background may grant you access to one or more extra languages of your choice. Make sure to note these languages on your character sheet.

Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or pick one that is common in your campaign. With your GM's permission, you can instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language, such as thieves' cant or the tongue of druids.

Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental planes. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can communicate with one another.
