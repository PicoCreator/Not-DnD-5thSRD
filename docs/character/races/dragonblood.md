The Dragonborn are a proud and noble race, descended from the great dragons of old. They are tall and strong, standing well over six feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. They are known for their strength and charisma, and their ability to breathe destructive energy.

Dragonborn reach maturity at the age of fifteen, and can live to be around eighty years old. They tend to extremes, choosing either good or evil in the cosmic war between the two.

Dragonborn have a variety of traits that they share with other dragonborn, including an increase in their Strength score by two and their Charisma score by one. They also have a base walking speed of thirty feet.

The type of dragon that a Dragonborn is descended from determines their breath weapon and damage resistance. For example, a Dragonborn descended from a Black Dragon has a breath weapon of a 5 by 30 ft. line of acid, and resistance to acid damage.

Dragonborn can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic, the ancient language of dragons.
