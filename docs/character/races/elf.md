# Elf 
## Elf Traits 
- - -
Your elven character is blessed with a variety of natural gifts, honed over centuries of refinement. 

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score is increased by two. 

**Age.** Elves reach physical maturity at a similar age to humans, but their understanding of adulthood is far more complex. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name at around one hundred years of age, and can live to be as old as seven hundred and fifty. 

**Alignment.** Elves are drawn to the more chaotic aspects of life, and value freedom, variety, and self-expression. They are more often good than not, with the exception of the drow, who have been driven to viciousness and danger by their exile. 

**Size.** Elves range from under five to over six feet tall, and have slender builds. Your size is Medium. 

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is thirty feet. 

**Darkvision.** Elves are accustomed to the twilight of forests and the night sky, and have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within sixty feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Keen Senses.** You have proficiency in the Perception skill. 

**Fey Ancestry.** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep. 

**Trance.** Elves do not need to sleep, instead they meditate deeply for four hours a day, remaining semiconscious. This meditation is known as a trance, and through years of practice, elves can gain the same benefit from it as humans do from eight hours of sleep. 

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is a complex language, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are renowned among other races. Many bards learn their language to add Elvish ballads to their repertoires. 

## High Elf 
As a high elf, you possess a sharp mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is proud and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more common and friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races. 

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score is increased by one. 

**Elf Weapon Training.** You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow. 

**Cantrip.** You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it. 

**Extra Language.** You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.
