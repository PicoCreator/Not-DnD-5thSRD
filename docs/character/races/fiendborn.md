## Tiefling Traits 
- - -
Tieflings, due to their infernal descent, share certain racial traits. 

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence is increased by 1, and your Charisma is increased by 2. 

**Age.** Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans, but live a few years longer. 

**Alignment.** Tieflings may not have an innate tendency towards evil, but many of them end up there. An independent nature often leads many tieflings to a chaotic alignment. 

**Size.** Tieflings are of the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium. 

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 

**Darkvision.** Your infernal heritage grants you superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. 

**Hellish Resistance.** You have resistance to fire damage. 

**Infernal Legacy.** You know the **_thaumaturgy_** cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the **_hellish rebuke_** spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the **_darkness_** spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. 

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.
