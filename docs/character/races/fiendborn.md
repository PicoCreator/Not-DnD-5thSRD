The Tieflings, a race of infernal descent, share certain traits that set them apart from other races. 

**Ability Score Increase.** Tieflings are known for their sharp minds and persuasive tongues, and thus their Intelligence and Charisma scores are increased by 1 and 2 respectively. 

**Age.** Tieflings reach maturity at the same rate as humans, but tend to live a few years longer. 

**Alignment.** Though not inherently evil, many Tieflings find themselves drawn to chaotic alignments due to their independent nature. 

**Size.** Tieflings are of a similar size and build to humans, and thus are of Medium size. 

**Speed.** Tieflings have a base walking speed of 30 feet. 

**Darkvision.** Tieflings have superior vision in dark and dim conditions, allowing them to see in dim light within 60 feet of them as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. However, they cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. 

**Hellish Resistance.** Tieflings have resistance to fire damage. 

**Infernal Legacy.** Tieflings are able to cast the **_thaumaturgy_** cantrip, and at 3rd level they can cast the **_hellish rebuke_** spell once and regain the ability to do so after a long rest. At 5th level, they can cast the **_darkness_** spell once and regain the ability to do so after a long rest. Charisma is their spellcasting ability for these spells. 

**Languages.** Tieflings can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.
