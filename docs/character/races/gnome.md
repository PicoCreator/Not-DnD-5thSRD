# The Gnome Race

The Gnomes are a race of small, yet hardy folk, renowned for their inventiveness and natural curiosity. They are most often of a goodly nature, and even the tricksters among them are more mischievous than malicious.

Gnomes mature at the same rate as humans, and are expected to settle into adulthood by the age of forty. They can live for up to five centuries, and are typically between three and four feet tall, weighing around forty pounds.

Gnomes have a natural affinity for the arcane, and are gifted with a sharp intellect. As such, their Intelligence score increases by two. They also possess a strong constitution, and their Constitution score increases by one.

Gnomes are able to speak, read, and write both Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish language is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.

Gnomes are also gifted with Darkvision, allowing them to see in dim light within sixty feet of them as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. However, they are unable to discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

Gnomes are also gifted with a natural cunning, granting them advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.

Finally, Gnomes have a base walking speed of twenty-five feet.

## Rock Gnomes

Rock Gnomes are a subrace of Gnomes, possessing a natural inventiveness and hardiness beyond that of other Gnomes.

Rock Gnomes are gifted with Artificer's Lore, allowing them to add twice their proficiency bonus to any Intelligence (History) checks related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices.

Rock Gnomes are also proficient with Tinker's Tools, allowing them to spend one hour and ten gold pieces worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device. This device has an Armor Class of five and one hit point, and ceases to function after twenty-four hours, or when the Rock Gnome uses their action to dismantle it. The Rock Gnome can reclaim the materials used to create the device when it is dismantled.

When creating a device, the Rock Gnome can choose from the following options:

* Clockwork Toy: This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves five feet across the ground on each of the Rock Gnome's turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.

* Fire Starter: The device produces a miniature flame, which can be used to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires the Rock Gnome's action.

* Music Box: When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed.
