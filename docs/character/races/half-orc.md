# Half-Orc 
## Half-Orc Traits 
- - -
Your half-orc character is blessed with certain traits from their orc ancestry. 

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength is bolstered by 2, and your Constitution is bolstered by 1. 

**Age.** Half-orcs reach adulthood at a younger age than humans, typically around 14 years old. They age more quickly and rarely live longer than 75 years. 

**Alignment.** Half-orcs are naturally inclined towards chaos, inherited from their orc parents. Those raised among orcs and willing to live out their lives among them are usually of an evil nature. 

**Size.** Half-orcs are larger and bulkier than humans, ranging from 5 to over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium. 

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 

**Darkvision.** Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t distinguish colors in darkness, only shades of gray. 

**Menacing.** You are proficient in the Intimidation skill. 

**Relentless Endurance.** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can instead drop to 1 hit point. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. 

**Savage Attacks.** When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.
 
**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc. Orc is a harsh, grating language with hard consonants. It has no script of its own but is written in the Dwarvish script.
