Your halfling character has a number of qualities shared with all other halflings. 

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score is increased by 2. 

**Age.** A halfling reaches maturity at the age of 20 and usually lives to the middle of their second century. 

**Alignment.** Most halflings are of a lawful good nature. As a rule, they are kind-hearted and compassionate, loathe to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, relying heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways. 

**Size.** Halflings are usually around 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small. 

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. 

**Lucky.** When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. 

**Brave.** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

**Halfling Nimbleness.** You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours. 

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language is not a secret, but halflings are reluctant to share it with others. They write very little, so they do not have a large body of literature. However, their oral tradition is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to communicate with the people in whose lands they live or through which they are travelling.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score is increased by 1. 

**Naturally Stealthy.** You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.
