## Dwarven Traits
- - -
Your dwarven character has a number of traits in common with all other dwarves. 

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 2. 

**Age.** A dwarf reaches adulthood at the age of 50 and generally lives into the middle of his or her third century. 

**Alignment.** Most dwarves are lawful good. As a rule, they are stalwart and honorable, standing up for what is right and just. They are also fiercely loyal to their families and clans, and will go to great lengths to protect them. 

**Size.** Dwarves average about 4 feet tall and weigh about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium. 

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor. 

**Darkvision.** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. 

**Dwarven Resilience.** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage. 

**Tool Proficiency.** You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools. 

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak. 

## Hill 
As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience. The gold dwarves of Faerûn in their mighty southern kingdom are hill dwarves, as are the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar of Krynn in the Dragonlance setting. 

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score increases by 1. 

**Dwarven Toughness.** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.
