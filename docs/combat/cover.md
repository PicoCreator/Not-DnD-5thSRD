# Cover in Combat
Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide protection during battle, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can only benefit from cover when an attack or other effect originates from the opposite side of the cover.

There are three levels of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective level of cover applies; the levels are not combined. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

A target with **half cover** has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle could be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

A target with **three-quarters** cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle could be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

A target with **total cover** cannot be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.
