In the world of combat, one can find solace in the protection of walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles. These can provide a shield of sorts, making it more difficult for one's enemies to harm them. However, the cover only applies when the attack or effect originates from the opposite side of the cover.

There are three levels of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees are not combined. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

A target with **half cover** is granted a +2 bonus to their Armor Class and Dexterity saving throws. This is achieved when an obstacle blocks at least half of their body. This obstacle could be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether it be an enemy or an ally.

A target with **three-quarters** cover is granted a +5 bonus to their Armor Class and Dexterity saving throws. This is achieved when about three-quarters of their body is covered by an obstacle. This obstacle could be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

A target with **total cover** cannot be targeted directly by an attack or a spell. However, some spells can still reach them by including them in an area of effect. Total cover is achieved when the target is completely concealed by an obstacle.
