In the fantastical realm of adventure, injury and death are ever-present dangers. Hit points represent a creature's physical and mental fortitude, their will to live, and their luck. A creature's current hit points can range from their maximum to 0, and any damage taken is subtracted from this number. 

When attacking with a weapon, one adds their ability modifier to the damage. When a spell or other effect deals damage to multiple targets, the damage is rolled once for all of them. When a critical hit is scored, the damage dice are rolled twice and added together. 

Different attacks, spells, and other effects deal different types of damage. These include acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, piercing, poison, psychic, radiant, slashing, and thunder. Some creatures and objects are more resistant or vulnerable to certain types of damage. 

Damage is not permanent, and healing can restore a creature's hit points. Hit points regained cannot exceed a creature's hit point maximum, and a creature that has died cannot regain hit points until they are restored to life. 

## Reaching Zero Vitality
When you reach zero vitality, you either perish instantly or fall into a deep slumber, as detailed in the following sections.

### Instant Death 
A grievous amount of damage can cause you to perish in an instant. When the damage reduces you to zero vitality and there is still damage remaining, you will die if the remaining damage is equal to or greater than your maximum vitality.

For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 vitality currently has 6 vitality. If they take 18 damage from an attack, they are reduced to zero vitality, but 12 damage remains. As the remaining damage is equal to their maximum vitality, the cleric will perish. 

### Falling Unconscious 
If the damage reduces you to zero vitality and fails to kill you, you will fall into a deep slumber. This unconsciousness will end if you regain any vitality. 

### Fate's Saving Throws 
Whenever you start your turn with zero vitality, you must make a special saving throw, called a fate's saving throw, to determine whether you inch closer to death or cling to life. Unlike other saving throws, this one is not tied to any ability score. You are now in the hands of fate, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.

Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures do not need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any vitality or become stable.

**Rolling 1 or 20.** When you make a fate's saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 vitality.

**Damage at 0 Vitality.** If you take any damage while you have zero vitality, you suffer a fate's saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage is equal to or greater than your maximum vitality, you suffer instant death. 

### Stabilizing a Creature 
The best way to save a creature with zero vitality is to heal them. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that they are not killed by a failed fate's saving throw.

You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize them, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

A **stable** creature does not make fate's saving throws, even though they have zero vitality, but they do remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making fate's saving throws again, if they take any damage. A stable creature that is not healed regains 1 vitality after 1d4 hours. 

### Monsters and Death 
Most Game Masters have a monster die the instant it drops to zero vitality, rather than having it fall unconscious and make fate's saving throws.

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the Game Master might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters. 

## Knocking a Creature Out 
Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to zero vitality with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable. 

## Temporary Vitality 
Some spells and special abilities confer temporary vitality to a creature. Temporary vitality is not actual vitality; it is a buffer against damage, a pool of vitality that protects you from injury.

When you have temporary vitality and take damage, the temporary vitality is lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal vitality. For example, if you have 5 temporary vitality and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary vitality and then take 2 damage.

Because temporary vitality is separate from your actual vitality, it can exceed your maximum vitality. A character can, therefore, be at full vitality and receive temporary vitality.

Healing cannot restore temporary vitality, and they cannot be added together. If you have temporary vitality and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary vitality when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

If you have zero vitality, receiving temporary vitality does not restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you.

Unless a feature that grants you temporary vitality has a duration, they last until they are depleted or you finish a long rest.
