Description: Rules for tracking injury, death and healing.

# Damage and Healing 
The risk of injury and death are ever-present for those who explore the realms of fantasy gaming. A thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a **_fireball_** spell can all cause damage, or even death, to the hardiest of creatures. 

## Hit Points 
Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental strength, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill, while those with fewer hit points are more fragile.

A creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can range from the creature's hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points. 

## Damage Rolls 
Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.

When attacking with a **weapon**, you add your ability modifier--the same modifier used for the attack roll--to the damage. A **spell** tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.

If a spell or other effect deals damage to **more than one target** at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts **_fireball_** or a cleric casts **_flame strike_**, the spell's damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast. 

### Critical Hits 
When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.

For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue's Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well. 

### Damage Types 
Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.

The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.

**Acid.** The corrosive spray of a black dragon's breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.

**Bludgeoning.** Blunt force attacks--hammers, falling, constriction, and the like--deal bludgeoning damage.

**Cold.** The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil's spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon's breath deal cold damage.

**Fire.** Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.

**Force.** Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including **_magic missile_** and **_spiritual weapon_**.

**Lightning.** A **_lightning bolt_** spell and a blue dragon's breath deal lightning damage.

**Necrotic.** Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as **_chill touch_**, withers matter and even the soul.

**Piercing.** Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters' bites, deal piercing damage.

**Poison.** Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon's breath deal poison damage.

**Psychic.** Mental abilities such as a psionic blast deal psychic damage.

**Radiant.** Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric's **_flame strike_** spell or an angel's smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.

**Slashing.** Swords, axes, and monsters' claws deal slashing damage.

**Thunder.** A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the **_thunderwave spell_**, deals thunder damage. 

## Damage Resistance and Vulnerability 
Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.

If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters. 

## Healing 
Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature's hit points, and magical methods such as a **_cure wounds_** spell or a **potion of healing** can remove damage in an instant.

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.

A creature that has died can't regain hit points until magic such as the **_revivify_** spell has brought it back to life.
## Falling to 0 Hit Points
When thou fall to 0 hit points, thou either die outright or become unconscious, as explained in the following sections.

### Instant Death 
Massive damage can kill thee instantly. When damage reduces thee to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, thou die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds thy hit point maximum.

For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies. 

### Becoming Unconscious 
If damage reduces thee to 0 hit points and fails to kill thee, thou become unconscious. This unconsciousness ends if thou regain any hit points. 

### Fate Saving Throws 
Whenever thou start thy turn with 0 hit points, thou must make a special saving throw, called a fate saving throw, to determine whether thou creep closer to death or cling onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score. Thou art in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve thy chances of succeeding on a saving throw.

Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, thou succeed. Otherwise, thou fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On thy third success, thou become stable (see below). On thy third failure, thou die. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until thou collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when thou regain any hit points or become stable.

**Rolling 1 or 20.** When thou make a fate saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If thou roll a 20 on the d20, thou regain 1 hit point.

**Damage at 0 Hit Points.** If thou take any damage while thou have 0 hit points, thou suffer a fate saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, thou suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds thy hit point maximum, thou suffer instant death. 

### Stabilizing a Creature 
The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed fate saving throw.

Thou can use thy action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

A **stable** creature doesn't make fate saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making fate saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours. 

### Monsters and Death 
Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it become unconscious and make fate saving throws.

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them become unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters. 

## Knocking a Creature Out 
Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature becomes unconscious and is stable. 

## Temporary Hit Points 
Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect thee from injury.

When thou have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to thy normal hit points. For example, if thou have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, thou lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.

Because temporary hit points are separate from thy actual hit points, they can exceed thy hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.

Healing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If thou have temporary hit points and receive more of them, thou decide whether to keep the ones thou have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants thee 12 temporary hit points when thou already have 10, thou can have 12 or 10, not 22.

If thou have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore thee to consciousness or stabilize thee. They can still absorb damage directed at thee while thou're in that state, but only true healing can save thee.

Unless a feature that grants thee temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or thou finish a long rest.
