# Making an Attack
When engaging in battle, whether with a melee weapon, a ranged weapon, or a spell, the process of making an attack is quite simple. 

1. **Choose a Target.** Select a foe within your attack's range, be it a creature, an object, or a location.
2. **Calculate Modifiers.** The Game Master will determine if the target has any cover, and if you have any advantage or disadvantage against them. Additionally, spells, special abilities, and other effects may add bonuses or penalties to your attack roll.
3. **Resolve the Attack.** Roll the dice and add any modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers is equal to or greater than the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack is successful. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, while the AC of a monster is found in its stat block.

If ever there is any doubt as to whether something you are doing counts as an attack, the answer is simple: if you are making an attack roll, you are making an attack. 

## Attack Rolls
When making an attack, the attack roll will determine whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add any applicable modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers is equal to or greater than the target's AC, the attack is successful.

### Modifiers to the Roll
When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.

**Ability Modifier.** The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule. 

Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.

**Proficiency Bonus.** You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell. 

### Rolling 1 or 20
Sometimes fortune smiles upon a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is known as a critical hit, and is explained further in this chapter.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. 

## Unseen Attackers and Targets
In the heat of battle, combatants may attempt to hide, cast the invisibility spell, or lurk in the shadows in order to avoid detection.

When you attack a target that you cannot see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you are guessing the target's location or you are targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target is not in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the Game Master will typically just say that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly.

When a creature cannot see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden - both unseen and unheard - when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

## Ranged Attacks
When making a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe from a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack. 

### Ranged Combat
When engaging in ranged combat, one must take into account the range of their attack. If the attack has a single range, one cannot attack a target beyond this range. However, some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. When attacking a target beyond the normal range, one's attack roll is made with disadvantage, and one cannot attack a target beyond the long range.

When making a ranged attack in close combat, one must be wary of the difficulty of aiming. When making a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, one has disadvantage on the attack roll if they are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see them and who isn't incapacitated.

### Melee Attacks
Melee attacks are used in hand-to-hand combat, allowing one to attack a foe within their reach. Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.

Rather than using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, one can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + one's Strength modifier. One is proficient with their unarmed strikes.

### Opportunity Attacks
In the heat of battle, one must be ever vigilant for an opportunity to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is known as an opportunity attack.

One can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that they can see moves out of their reach. To make the opportunity attack, one uses their reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves their reach.

One can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. One also does not provoke an opportunity attack when they teleport or when someone or something moves them without using their movement, action, or reaction. For example, one does not provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls them out of a foe's reach or if gravity causes them to fall past an enemy.

### Two-Weapon Fighting
When one takes the Attack action and attacks with a light melee weapon that they are holding in one hand, they can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that they are holding in the other hand. They do not add their ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.

If either weapon has the thrown property, they can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.

### Contests in Combat
At times, battle may involve pitting one's prowess against that of their foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.

### Grappling
When one wishes to grab a creature or wrestle with it, they can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. The target of the grapple must be no more than one size larger than them and must be within their reach. Using at least one free hand, they attempt to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If they succeed, they subject the target to the grappled condition. The condition specifies the things that end it, and they can release the target whenever they like (no action required).

To escape a grapple, the grappled creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the grappler's Strength (Athletics) check. When the grappler moves, they can drag or carry the grappled creature with them, but their speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than them.

### Shoving a Creature
Using the Attack action, one can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from them. The target must be no more than one size larger than them and must be within their reach. Instead of making an attack roll, they make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If they win the contest, they either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from them.
