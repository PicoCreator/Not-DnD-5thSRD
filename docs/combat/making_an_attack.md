Description: Rules for making an attack in an oldern english style.

# Making an Attack 
Whether you be striking with a blade, firing a weapon from afar, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack follows a simple structure. 

1. **Choose a target.** Select a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2. **Determine modifiers.** The GM decides if the target has cover and if you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can give penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.
3. **Resolve the attack.** You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.

If there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're making an attack roll, you're making an attack. 

## Attack Rolls 
When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers is equal to or greater than the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block. 

### Modifiers to the Roll 
When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.

**Ability Modifier.** The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule. 

Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.

**Proficiency Bonus.** You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell. 

### Rolling 1 or 20 
Sometimes fortune blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. 

## Unseen Attackers and Targets 
Combatants oft try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.

When you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you be guessing the target's location or you be targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly.

When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you be hidden--both unseen and unheard--when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

## Ranged Attacks 
When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.
### Combat Range
When making a ranged attack, such as one with a spell, the target must be within the specified range. Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. If the target is beyond the normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage, and the target cannot be attacked beyond the long range.

### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat
When making a ranged attack with a weapon, spell, or other means, disadvantage is applied to the attack roll if the attacker is within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see them and is not incapacitated.

## Melee Attacks
Melee attacks are used in hand-to-hand combat and allow the attacker to target a foe within their reach. Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have a greater reach than 5 feet.

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee attack, an unarmed strike can be used. On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + the attacker's Strength modifier. The attacker is proficient with their unarmed strikes.

### Opportunity Attacks
When a hostile creature that the attacker can see moves out of their reach, they can use their reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. This is known as an opportunity attack. An opportunity attack can be avoided by taking the Disengage action. Teleporting or being moved without using movement, action, or reaction does not provoke an opportunity attack.

### Two-Weapon Fighting
When making an attack action with a light melee weapon held in one hand, a bonus action can be used to attack with a different light melee weapon held in the other hand. The bonus attack does not add the attacker's ability modifier to the damage, unless that modifier is negative. If either weapon has the thrown property, it can be thrown instead of making a melee attack.

### Contests in Combat
Combat often involves pitting one's prowess against that of their foe. This is represented by a contest. Common contests that require an action in combat include grappling and shoving a creature.

### Grappling
When attempting to grab a creature or wrestle with it, a grapple can be used. The target must be no more than one size larger than the attacker and must be within their reach. A Strength (Athletics) check is made instead of an attack roll, contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If successful, the target is subjected to the grappled condition. The grappled creature can use their action to escape, succeeding on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the attacker's Strength (Athletics) check. When the attacker moves, they can drag or carry the grappled creature with them, but their speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than them.

### Shoving a Creature
Using the Attack action, a special melee attack can be made to shove a creature, either to knock them prone or push them away. The target must be no more than one size larger than the attacker and must be within their reach. A Strength (Athletics) check is made instead of an attack roll, contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If successful, the target is either knocked prone or pushed 5 feet away from the attacker.
