# Mounted Combat

The thrill of battle is heightened when one is mounted atop a noble steed, a griffon, or a pegasus. Such creatures provide a speed and mobility that can be the difference between victory and defeat.

Any willing creature of appropriate size and anatomy can serve as a mount, provided the following rules are observed.

## Mounting and Dismounting

When astride a mount, one may mount or dismount at any point during their movement, provided they have sufficient movement remaining. For example, if one's speed is 30 feet, they must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse.

Should an effect move the mount against its will while one is mounted, they must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be thrown off, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of the mount. If one is knocked prone while mounted, they must make the same saving throw.

If the mount is knocked prone, one may use their reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on their feet. Otherwise, they are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet of the mount.

## Controlling a Mount

When mounted, one may either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, will act independently.

A mount may only be controlled if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match the rider's when they mount it. It moves as directed, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that the rider mounts it.

An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider does not restrict the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It may flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against the rider's wishes.

In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while the rider is mounted, the attacker may target either the rider or the mount.
