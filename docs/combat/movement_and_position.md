# Movement and Positioning
In battle, characters and monsters are ever-shifting, oftentimes using their movement and positioning to gain the advantage.

On your turn, you may move a distance up to your speed. You may use as much or as little of your speed as you wish on your turn, abiding by the rules herein.

Your movement may include leaping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement may be combined with walking, or they may constitute your entire move. Regardless of how you move, you must deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.

## Breaking Up Your Move
You may break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For instance, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you may move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.

### Moving between Attacks
If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you may break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.

### Using Different Speeds
If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you may switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you cannot use the new speed during the current move.

For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 due to a wizard casting the Fly spell upon you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.

## Difficult Terrain
Combat rarely takes place in empty rooms or on featureless plains. Caverns strewn with boulders, forests choked with briars, treacherous staircases--the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs an extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.
## Being Prostrate 
Fighters oft find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are felled or because they cast themselves down. In the game, they are prostrate, a condition described in appendix A. Thou canst drop prostrate without using any of thy speed. Rising up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half thy speed. For example, if thy speed is 30 feet, thou must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. Thou canst not stand up if thou hast not enough movement left or if thy speed is 0.

To move while prostrate, thou must **crawl** or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of
movement.

>### Interacting with Objects 
>Around Thee Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing thou canst do in tandem with thy movement and action:

>* draw or sheathe a sword
>* open or close a door
>* withdraw a potion from thy backpack
>* pick up a dropped axe
>* take a bauble from a table
>* remove a ring from thy finger
>* stuff some food into thy mouth 
>* plant a banner in the ground
>* fish a few coins from thy belt pouch
>* drink all the ale in a flagon
>* throw a lever or a switch
>* pull a torch from a sconce
>* take a book from a shelf thou canst reach
>* extinguish a small flame
>* don a mask
>* pull the hood of thy cloak up and over thy head
>* put thy ear to a door
>* kick a small stone
>* turn a key in a lock
>* tap the floor with a 10-foot pole
>* hand an item to another character 

## Moving Around Other Creatures 
Thou canst move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, thou canst move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than thee. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for thee.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, thou canst not willingly end thy move in its space.

If thou leavest a hostile creature's reach during thy move, thou provokest an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter. 

## Flying Movement 
Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prostrate, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the **_fly_** spell. 

## Creature Size 
Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories. 

**Size Categories** 

| Size       | Space                  |
|------------|------------------------|
| Tiny       | 2 1/2 by 2 1/2 ft.     |
| Small      | 5 by 5 ft.             |
| Medium     | 5 by 5 ft.             |
| Large      | 10 by 10 ft.           |
| Huge       | 15 by 15 ft.           |
| Gargantuan | 20 by 20 ft. or larger |


### Space 
A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it doth control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5‚Äêfoot-wide doorway, other creatures canst not get through unless the hobgoblin letteth them.

A creature's space also reflecteth the area it needeth to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.

Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one. 

### Squeezing into a Smaller Space 
A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it hath disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.
