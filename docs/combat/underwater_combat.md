# Combat Underwater
When adventurers pursue their foes to the depths of the sea, battle sharks in sunken ships, or find themselves in a flooded chamber, they must fight in a difficult environment. The following rules apply when engaging in combat underwater.

When making a **melee weapon attack**, a creature that does not possess a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has a disadvantage on the attack roll, unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.

A **ranged weapon attack** will always miss a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has a disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).

Creatures and objects that are completely submerged in water have resistance to fire damage.
