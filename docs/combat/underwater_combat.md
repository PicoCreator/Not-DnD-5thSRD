When brave adventurers venture into the depths of the sea, they must be prepared to face the dangers of the deep. In such a hostile environment, the following rules apply:

When making a **melee weapon attack**, a creature that does not possess the ability to swim (either naturally or through magical means) suffers a disadvantage on their attack roll, unless they are wielding a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.

A **ranged weapon attack** will always miss its target if it is beyond the weapon's normal range. Even if the target is within the weapon's normal range, the attack roll will suffer a disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).

Creatures and objects that are fully submerged in water are resistant to fire damage.
