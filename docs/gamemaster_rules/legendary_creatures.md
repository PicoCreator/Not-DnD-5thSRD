# Legendary Beings
Legendary beings possess powers that ordinary creatures cannot. They can take special actions outside of their turn, and may even exert magical influence over a wide area.

If a creature takes the form of a legendary being, such as through a spell, they do not gain the legendary being's actions, lair actions, or regional effects.

## Legendary Actions
Legendary beings can take a certain number of special actions, known as legendary actions, outside of their turn. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. A creature regains their spent legendary actions at the start of their turn. They can choose not to use them, and cannot use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, they cannot use them until after their first turn in the combat.

## Lair of a Legendary Being
A legendary being may have a section describing their lair and the special effects it can create while they are there, either through their own will or simply by being present. Such a section only applies to a legendary being that spends a great deal of time in their lair.

### Lair Actions
If a legendary being has lair actions, they can use them to draw on the ambient magic in their lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), they can use one of their lair action options. They cannot do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, they cannot use one until after their first turn in the combat.

## Regional Effects
The presence of a legendary being can have strange and wondrous effects on their environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary being dies.
