# Legendary Creatures
Creatures of legend possess abilities far beyond those of ordinary beings. They can take special actions outside of their turn, and their presence can be felt for miles around.

If a creature takes on the form of a legendary creature, such as through a spell, they do not gain the legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects of that form.

## Legendary Actions
Legendary creatures can take a certain number of special actions - known as legendary actions - outside of their turn. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. A creature regains their spent legendary actions at the start of their turn, and they cannot use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, they cannot use them until after their first turn in combat.

## A Legendary Creature's Lair
Legendary creatures may have a section describing their lair and the special effects it can create while they are present, either through their own will or simply by being there. Such a section only applies to legendary creatures that spend a great deal of time in their lair.

### Lair Actions
If a legendary creature has lair actions, they can use them to draw upon the ambient magic of their lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), they can use one of their lair action options. They cannot do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, they cannot use one until after their first turn in combat.

## Regional Effects
The presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. These regional effects will abruptly end or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies.
