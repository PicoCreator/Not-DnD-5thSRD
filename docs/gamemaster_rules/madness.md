Description: Rules and descriptions for character madness in a different game world.

# Madness 
In a typical campaign, characters are not driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the strain of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you may want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face. 

## Going Mad 
Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise sound mind. Certain spells, such as **_contact other plane_** and **_symbol_**, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects of those spells. Diseases, poisons, and realm effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all induce madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.

Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. 

## Madness Effects 
Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness.

A character afflicted with **short-term madness** is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness table for 1d10 minutes.

A character afflicted with **long-term madness** is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness table for 1d10 Ã— 10 hours.

A character afflicted with **indefinite madness** gains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured.

## Curing Madness 
A **_calm emotions_** spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a **_lesser restoration_** spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, **_remove curse_** or **_dispel evil_** might also be effective. A **_greater restoration_** spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinite madness.
