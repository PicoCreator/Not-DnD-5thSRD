In this realm, magical items are found in the hoards of vanquished foes or hidden away in forgotten vaults. Such items grant capabilities that would otherwise be impossible, or they can enhance the abilities of their owner in remarkable ways.

Attunement is required for some magical items in order to unlock their power. To attune to an item, one must meet the prerequisites set forth by the item. For example, if the item requires a certain class, the attuner must be a member of that class. If the item requires a spellcaster, the attuner must be able to cast at least one spell using their own abilities, not through the use of a magical item.

Without attunement, a creature can only benefit from the nonmagical properties of the item, unless otherwise stated. For example, a magical shield that requires attunement will only provide the benefits of a normal shield to a creature that is not attuned to it.

Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest in physical contact with the item, while focusing solely on it. This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or any other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Upon completion of the short rest, the creature will gain an intuitive understanding of how to activate the magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words.

An item can only be attuned to one creature at a time, and a creature can only be attuned to a maximum of three magical items at once. If a creature attempts to attune to a fourth item, the attempt will fail. Additionally, a creature cannot attune to more than one copy of an item.

A creature's attunement to an item will end if the creature no longer meets the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed.

When using a magical item, one must wear or wield it as intended. For example, boots must be worn on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, and a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held.

In most cases, a magical item that is meant to be worn can fit any creature regardless of size or build. However, there are rare exceptions. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, then it will not adjust. For example, armor crafted by drow may only fit elves.

When a nonhumanoid attempts to wear an item, use your discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed on a tentacle may work, but a creature with a snakelike tail instead of legs cannot wear boots.

When it comes to wearing multiple items of the same kind, use common sense to determine whether it is possible. A character cannot normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, and one cloak. However, exceptions can be made; a character may be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, or to layer two cloaks.

### Paired Items 
Items that come in pairs--such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves--are only effective when both pieces of the set are worn. For example, a character wearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and a boot of elvenkind on the other foot will not receive any benefit from either. 

## Activating an Item 
Certain items must be activated in a special way, such as holding the item and speaking a command word. The description of each item category or individual item will explain how it is activated. The following rules apply to activating these items.

If an item requires an action to activate, that action cannot be done with the Use an Item action, so features such as the rogue's Fast Hands cannot be used to activate the item. 

### Command Word 
A command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken for an item to work. A magic item that requires a command word cannot be activated in an area where sound is prevented, such as the area of the silence spell. 

### Consumables 
Some items are used up when they are activated. A potion or an elixir must be consumed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing on a scroll will vanish when it is read. Once used, a consumable item will lose its magical properties. 

### Spells 
Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell level, does not require any of the user's spell slots, and does not require any components, unless the item's description states otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and instead grant the spell's effects, with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.

A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require the user to use their own spellcasting ability when casting a spell from the item. If the user has more than one spellcasting ability, they must choose which one to use with the item. If the user does not have a spellcasting ability--perhaps they are a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature--their spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and their proficiency bonus does apply. 

### Charges 
Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining can be revealed with an identify spell, as well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to it will learn how many charges it regained.
