# Magic Items 
Magical items are found in the hoards of defeated monsters or in long-forgotten vaults. Such items grant capabilities that a character would not normally possess, or they enhance the capabilities of their owner in remarkable ways. 

## Attunement 
Certain magical items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is known as attunement, and some items have prerequisites for it. If the prerequisite is a class, the creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if it has spell slots and uses that class's spell list.) If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, not using a magic item or the like.

Unless the item's description states otherwise, a creature that is not attuned to an item only gains its nonmagical benefits. For example, a magical shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature that is not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.

Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest in physical contact with it while focusing on it exclusively (this cannot be the same short rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words.

An item can only be attuned to one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must first end its attunement to an item. Additionally, a creature cannot attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature cannot attune to more than one ring of protection at a time.

A creature's attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer meets the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed. 

## Donning and Wielding 
Using a magic item's properties might require wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be put on in the intended fashion: boots on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held.

In most cases, a magic item that is meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magical garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer. Exceptions do exist, however. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it does not adjust. For example, armor made by drow might fit elves only. Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized and dwarf-shaped folk.

When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a creature with a snakelike tail instead of legs cannot wear boots. 

### Multiple Items of the Same Kind 
Use common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character cannot normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, and one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or to layer two cloaks.
### Paired Pieces 
Pieces that come in pairs--such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves--only bestow their benefits if both pieces of the pair are worn. For instance, a character wearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and a boot of elvenkind on the other foot will not gain any benefit from either. 

## Activating a Piece 
To activate some magical pieces, a user must do something special, such as grasping the item and speaking a command word. The description of each item category or individual item will explain how an item is activated. The following rules apply to the activation of certain pieces.

If an item requires an action to activate, that action is not part of the Use an Item action, so a feature such as the rogue's Fast Hands cannot be used to activate the item. 

### Command Word 
A command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken for an item to work. A magical item that requires a command word cannot be activated in an area where sound is prevented, such as the area of the silence spell. 

### Consumables 
Some pieces are used up when they are activated. A potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing on a scroll vanishes when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic. 

### Spells 
Some magical items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell level, does not expend any of the user's spell slots, and requires no components, unless the item's description states otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell's effects, with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.

A magical item, such as certain staffs, may require the user to use their own spellcasting ability when casting a spell from the item. If the user has more than one spellcasting ability, they must choose which one to use with the item. If the user does not have a spellcasting ability--perhaps they are a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature--their spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and their proficiency bonus does apply. 

### Charges 
Some magical items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learns how many charges it has regained.
