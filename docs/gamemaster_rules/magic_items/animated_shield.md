# Mystic Aegis
_Armor (shield), of the utmost rarity (requires attunement)_

When you grasp this shield, you may utter its command word as a bonus action to bring it to life. The shield will ascend into the air and hover in your vicinity, shielding you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The shield will remain animated for one minute, or until you use a bonus action to end the effect, or until you are incapacitated or pass away, at which point the shield will fall to the ground or into your hand if you have one free.
