# Animated Aegis
_Armour (shield), very rare (requires attunement)_

Whilst grasping this shield, you can utter its command word as a bonus action to cause it to animate. The shield will ascend into the air and hover in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The shield will remain animated for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or pass away, at which point the shield will fall to the ground or into your hand if you have one free.
