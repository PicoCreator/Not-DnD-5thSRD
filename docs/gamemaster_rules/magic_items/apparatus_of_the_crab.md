# Apparatus of the Crab 
_Wondrous item, legendary_ 

This item appears to be a large, sealed iron barrel, weighing a hefty 500 pounds. With a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a hidden catch can be found, unlocking a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to be moved up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms into a giant lobster. The apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:

**Armor Class:** 20    
**Hit Points:** 200    
**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)    
**Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic 

To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. When the hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight, providing enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.

The apparatus floats on water and can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.

A creature in the compartment can use an action to move up to two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, the lever returns to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.

The apparatus floats on water and can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from the crushing pressure.

A creature in the compartment can use an action to move up to two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, the lever returns to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.
