# Armor of Vulnerability 
_Armor (plate), rare (requires attunement)_ 

Whilst donning this armor, the wearer is granted resistance to one of the following types of damage: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The GM shall choose the type or determine it randomly.

**Curse.** This armor is cursed, a fact that is only revealed when a **_identify_** spell is cast upon the armor or when the wearer attunes to it. Attuning to the armor shall curse the wearer until they are targeted by the **_remove curse_** spell or similar magic; removing the armor shall not end the curse. Whilst cursed, the wearer shall have vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants resistance).
