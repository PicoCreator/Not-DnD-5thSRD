# Aegis of the Arrow
_Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)_

When you don this shield, you are granted a +2 bonus to your Armor Class against ranged attacks. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal protection. Furthermore, when an enemy launches a ranged attack against a target within five feet of you, you may use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead.
