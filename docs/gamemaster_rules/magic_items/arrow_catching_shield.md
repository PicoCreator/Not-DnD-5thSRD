# Arrow-Catching Buckler
_Armour (shield), rare (requires attunement)_

When you bear this buckler, you gain a +2 bonus to your Armour Class against ranged attacks. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. Moreover, when an attacker makes a ranged attack against a creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead.
