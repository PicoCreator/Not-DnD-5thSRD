# Arrow of Vanquishing
_Weapon (arrow), very rare_

An **arrow of vanquishing** is a magical weapon crafted to defeat a certain type of creature. Some are more specific than others; for instance, there are both **arrows of dragon vanquishing** and **arrows of blue dragon vanquishing**. If a creature of the type, race, or group associated with an **arrow of vanquishing** takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once an **arrow of vanquishing** has dealt its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a mundane arrow.

Other types of magical ammunition of this kind exist, such as **bolts of vanquishing** meant for a crossbow, though arrows are the most common.
