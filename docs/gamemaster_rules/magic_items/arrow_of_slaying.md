# Arrow of Vanquishing
_Weapon (arrow), very rare_

An **Arrow of Vanquishing** is a magical weapon crafted to bring an end to a particular type of creature. Some are more specific than others; for example, there are both **Arrows of Dragon Vanquishing** and **Arrows of Blue Dragon Vanquishing**. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an **Arrow of Vanquishing** is struck by the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an additional 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once an **Arrow of Vanquishing** has dealt its extra damage to a creature, it reverts to a mundane arrow.

Other types of magical ammunition of this kind exist, such as **Bolts of Vanquishing** meant for a crossbow, though arrows are the most common.
