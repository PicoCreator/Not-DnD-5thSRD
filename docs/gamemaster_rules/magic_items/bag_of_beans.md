# Bag of Beans 
_A wondrous item of rarest kind_ 

This heavy cloth bag contains 3d4 dry beans, each adding a quarter pound to the bag's weight of half a pound.

Should the contents of the bag be scattered upon the ground, a great explosion will ensue, with a radius of ten feet. All creatures within the area, including the one who scattered the beans, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail will suffer 5d4 fire damage, while those who succeed will suffer only half that amount. The fire will also ignite any flammable objects in the area that are not being worn or carried.

Should a single bean be removed from the bag and planted in dirt or sand, and then watered, an effect will manifest one minute later from the ground where it was planted. The GM may choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect of their own. 

| d100  | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 01    | 5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, they must roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer 5d6 poison damage and become poisoned for one hour. On an even roll, the eater will gain 5d6 temporary hit points for one hour. |
| 02-10 | A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, berry juice, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (GM's choice) thirty feet into the air for 1d12 rounds. |
| 11-20 | A treant sprouts. There is a fifty percent chance that the treant is chaotic evil and will attack. |
| 21-30 | An animate, immobile stone statue in the likeness of the one who planted the bean rises. It will make verbal threats against them. If the one who planted the bean leaves, the statue will describe them as the most heinous of villains and direct any newcomers to find and attack them. If the one who planted the bean is on the same plane of existence as the statue, it will know their location. The statue will become inanimate after twenty-four hours. |
| 31-40 | A campfire with blue flames springs forth and burns for twenty-four hours (or until it is extinguished).
| 41-50 | 1d6 + 6 shriekers sprout |
| 51-60 | 1d4 + 8 bright pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is touched, it transforms into a Large or smaller monster of the GM's choice. The monster remains for one minute, then disappears in a puff of bright pink smoke. |
| 61-70 | A hungry bulette burrows up and attacks. |
| 71-80 | A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8 of which act as randomly determined magic potions, while one acts as an ingested poison of the GM's choice. The tree vanishes after one hour. Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic for thirty days. |
| 81-90 | A nest of 1d4 + 3 eggs springs up. Any creature that eats an egg must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature permanently increases their lowest ability score by one, randomly choosing among equally low scores. On a failed save, the creature suffers 10d6 force damage from an internal magical explosion. |
| 91-99 | A pyramid with a sixty-foot-square base bursts upward. Inside is a sarcophagus containing a mummy lord. The pyramid is treated as the mummy lord's lair, and its sarcophagus contains treasure of the GM's choice. |
| 00    | A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of the GM's choice. The top leads to a place of the GM's choosing, such as a great view, a cloud giant's castle, or a different plane of existence. |
