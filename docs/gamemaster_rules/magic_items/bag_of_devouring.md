# Bag of Devouring 
_Wondrous item, very rare_ 

This bag appears to be a bag of holding, but is in fact an opening to an extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out will close the orifice.

The creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside. Anything that is wholly placed in the bag will be devoured and lost forever. If a living creature reaches inside, there is a 50% chance that it will be pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can attempt to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag and pull a creature out, with a successful DC 20 Strength check. Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag will be devoured.

Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold up to a cubic foot of material. However, once a day, the bag will swallow any objects inside and spit them out into another plane of existence. The GM will determine the time and plane.

If the bag is pierced or torn, it will be destroyed and anything inside will be transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.
