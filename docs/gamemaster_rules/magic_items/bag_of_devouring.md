Name: Bag of Devouring
Type: Item

# Bag of Devouring
_Wondrous item, very rare_

This bag appears to be a bag of holding, but is in fact a portal to an extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out will close the portal.

The creature connected to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside it. Anything placed wholly in the bag will be devoured and lost forever. If a living creature reaches inside the bag, there is a 50% chance that the creature will be pulled inside. A creature inside the bag can attempt to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag and pull a creature out, with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag will be devoured, its body destroyed.

Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold up to a cubic foot of material. However, once a day, the bag will swallow any objects inside it and transport them to another plane of existence. The GM will determine the time and plane.

If the bag is pierced or torn, it will be destroyed, and anything inside it will be transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.
