# Bag of Wonders
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This bag appears to be of a modest size, yet its interior space is far greater than its outside dimensions, measuring roughly two feet in diameter at the mouth and four feet deep. It can hold up to 500 pounds of items, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet, and weighs 15 pounds regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.

Should the bag be overloaded, pierced, or torn, it will rupture and be destroyed, scattering its contents in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents will spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be righted before it can be used again. Creatures within the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they will begin to suffocate.

Placing a **Bag of Wonders** inside an extradimensional space created by a **Handy Haversack**, **Portable Hole**, or similar item will instantly destroy both items and open a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate will originate from the location of the item placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate will be sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane, after which the gate will close and cannot be reopened.
