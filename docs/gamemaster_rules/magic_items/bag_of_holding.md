# Bag of Holding
_Wondrous Item, Uncommon_

This bag has an interior space much larger than its outside dimensions, about 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. It can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet, and weighs 15 pounds regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.

If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it will rupture and be destroyed, and its contents will be scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents will spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be righted before it can be used again. Creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they will begin to suffocate.

Placing a **Bag of Holding** inside an extradimensional space created by a **Handy Haversack**, **Portable Hole**, or similar item will instantly destroy both items and open a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate will originate from the spot where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate will be sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate will then close and cannot be reopened.
