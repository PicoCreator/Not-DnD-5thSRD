# Bag of Wonders
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This seemingly ordinary bag, made of grey, rust, or tan cloth, appears to be empty. However, when one reaches inside, they will find a small, fuzzy object. The bag weighs half a pound.

Using an action, one can pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to twenty feet. When it lands, it will transform into a creature, determined by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag's color.

The creature is friendly to the user and their companions, and it will act on their turn. A bonus action can be used to command the creature's movement and action on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack enemies. If no orders are given, the creature will act in a manner appropriate to its nature.

Once three fuzzy objects have been taken from the bag, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
