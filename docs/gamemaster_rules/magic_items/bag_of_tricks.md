# Bag of Wonders
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This seemingly ordinary bag, crafted from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears to be empty. However, when one reaches inside, they can feel a small, fuzzy object. The bag weighs a mere half a pound.

One can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to twenty feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature determined by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag's color.

The creature is friendly to the user and their companions, and it acts on their turn. One can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack their enemies. If no orders are given, the creature will act in a manner befitting its nature.

Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag cannot be used again until the next dawn.
