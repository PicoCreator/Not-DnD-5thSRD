# Orb of Might
_Wondrous item, rare_

This small, ebony sphere measures three-quarters of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, a collection of 1d4 + 4 **Orbs of Might** can be found together.

You can use an action to hurl the orb up to sixty feet. Upon impact, the orb shatters and is destroyed. All creatures within a ten-foot radius of the point of impact must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for one minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only air can pass through the sphere's wall; no attack or other effect can.

An enclosed creature can use its action to press against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's walking speed. The sphere can be lifted, and its enchantment causes it to weigh only one pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.
