# Orb of Force
_Wondrous item, rare_

This small black sphere is three-quarters of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Generally, 1d4 + 4 **Orbs of Force** are found together.

You can use an action to hurl the orb up to 60 feet. The orb bursts upon impact and is destroyed. Every creature within a 10-foot radius of where the orb landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is confined inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can.

A confined creature can use its action to press against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's walking speed. The sphere can be lifted, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.
