# Girdle of Gigantic Might
_Enchanted item, rarity varies (requires attunement)_

When donning this girdle, your Strength score is augmented to a strength granted by the girdle. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than the girdle's strength, the item has no effect on you.

Six varieties of this girdle exist, corresponding with and having rarity according to the six kinds of true giants. The **girdle of stone giant might** and the **girdle of frost giant might** look different, but they have the same effect. 

| Type              | Strength | Rarity    |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|
| Hill giant        | 21       | Rare      |
| Stone/frost giant | 23       | Very rare |
| Fire giant        | 25       | Very rare |
| Cloud giant       | 27       | Legendary |
| Storm giant       | 29       | Legendary |
