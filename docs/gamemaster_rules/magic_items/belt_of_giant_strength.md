# Girdle of Giant Might
_Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)_

Whilst wearing this girdle, your Strength score is altered to the score granted by the girdle. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than the girdle's score, the item has no effect on you.

Six varieties of this girdle exist, corresponding with and having rarity according to the six kinds of true giants. The **girdle of hill giant might** and the **girdle of stone/frost giant might** look different, but they have the same effect.
