# Berserker's Axe 
_Weapon (any axe), rare (requires attunement)_ 

You are granted a boon of +1 to your attack and damage rolls when wielding this enchanted weapon. Furthermore, while you are attuned to this weapon, your maximum hit points shall increase by 1 for each level you have attained.

**Curse.** This axe is cursed, and by attuning to it, you shall be cursed as well. As long as you remain cursed, you shall be unwilling to part with the axe, keeping it within reach at all times. You shall also suffer disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

Whenever a hostile creature inflicts damage upon you while the axe is in your possession, you must pass a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or succumb to a berserk rage. While berserk, you must use your action each round to attack the nearest creature with the axe. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you shall use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you shall attack one at random. You shall remain berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.
