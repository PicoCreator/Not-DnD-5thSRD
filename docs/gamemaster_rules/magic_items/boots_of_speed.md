# Swift Striders
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

When these boots are donned, a bonus action can be used to click the heels together. Doing so doubles the wearer's walking speed, and any creature that attempts an opportunity attack against them has disadvantage on the roll. Clicking the heels together again ends the effect.

The enchantment of the boots lasts for a total of 10 minutes, after which the magic ceases to function until a long rest is completed.
