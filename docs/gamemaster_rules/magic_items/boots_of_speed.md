# Boots of Swiftness
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

When these boots are donned, the wearer may click their heels together as a bonus action. Doing so doubles their walking speed, and any creature that attempts to make an opportunity attack against them has disadvantage on the attack roll. To end the effect, the wearer must click their heels together again.

The magical properties of the boots cease to function after 10 minutes of use, and will not be restored until the wearer completes a long rest.
