# Leaping Boots of Striding
_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

When these boots are donned, the wearer's gait is quickened to a swift 30 feet, regardless of any encumbrance or heavy armor. Furthermore, the wearer can bound thrice the normal distance, though never further than their remaining movement would allow.
