# Leaping Boots
_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

Whilst wearing these boots, your walking speed is increased to 30 feet, unless it is already higher. Your speed is not reduced if you are encumbered or wearing heavy armour. Furthermore, you can jump three times the normal distance, though you cannot jump further than your remaining movement would allow.
