# Cauldron of Commanding Water Elementals 
_Wondrous item, rare_ 

When this cauldron is filled with water, you may use an action to utter the cauldron's command word and summon a water elemental, as if you had cast the **_conjure elemental_** spell. The cauldron cannot be used again until the following morn.

The cauldron is approximately one foot in diameter and half as deep. It weighs three pounds and holds up to three gallons of water.
