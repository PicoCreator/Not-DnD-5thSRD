# Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals 
_Wondrous item, rare_ 

Whilst this bowl is filled with water, you may use an action to speak the bowl's command word and summon a water elemental, as if you had cast the **_conjure elemental_** spell. The bowl cannot be used this way again until the next morn.

The bowl is about one foot in diameter and half as deep. It weighs three pounds and holds about three gallons.
