# Brazier of Commanding Flame Elementals
_Wondrous item, rare_

Whilst a flame burns in this brass brazier, you can use an action to utter the brazier's command word and summon a flame elemental, as if you had cast the **_conjure elemental_** spell. The brazier cannot be used this way again until the next morn. The brazier weighs 5 pounds.
