# Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals 
_Wondrous item, rare_ 

When a flame is lit within this brass brazier, you may use an action to utter the brazier's command word and summon a fire elemental, as if you had cast the **_conjure elemental_** spell. The brazier cannot be used again until the following morn. This brazier weighs a hefty five pounds.
