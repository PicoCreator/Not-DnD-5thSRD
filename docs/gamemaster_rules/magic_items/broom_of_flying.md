# Broom of Soaring
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This wooden broom, which weighs a trifling three pounds, appears to be a mundane broom until one stands astride it and speaks its command word. Then, it will hover beneath the rider, allowing them to soar through the air with a speed of fifty feet. It can carry up to four hundred pounds, though its speed is reduced to thirty feet when carrying more than two hundred pounds. The broom will cease its hovering when the rider alights.

The broom can be sent to a destination within one mile of the speaker, provided they are familiar with the place and name it when speaking the command word. The broom will return to its master when another command word is spoken, so long as it remains within one mile of its master.
