# Broom of Flight
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This wooden broom, weighing three pounds, appears to be a mundane broom until one stands astride it and speaks its command word. It then hovers beneath the rider, allowing them to fly with a speed of fifty feet. It can carry up to four hundred pounds, though its speed is reduced to thirty feet when carrying more than two hundred pounds. The broom stops hovering when the rider lands.

The broom can be sent to a destination within one mile of the speaker, provided they are familiar with the place and name it. The broom will return when another command word is spoken, so long as it is still within one mile of the speaker.
