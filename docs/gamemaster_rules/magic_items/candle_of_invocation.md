# Candle of Invocation 
_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_ 

This slender taper is consecrated to a divine being and bears the same alignment as its deity. The alignment of the candle can be discerned with the **_detect evil and good_** spell. The GM can choose the god and its associated alignment or randomly determine it. 

| d20   | Alignment       |
|-------|-----------------|
| 1-2   | Chaotic evil    |
| 3-4   | Chaotic neutral |
| 5-7   | Chaotic good    |
| 8-9   | Neutral evil    |
| 10-11 | Neutral         |
| 12-13 | Neutral good    |
| 14-15 | Lawful evil     |
| 16-17 | Lawful neutral  |
| 18-20 | Lawful good     |

The candle's power is activated when it is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is extinguished. You can snuff it out earlier for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.

When lit, the candle emits a dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle has advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle's can cast 1st-level spells they have prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.

Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the **_gate_** spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.
