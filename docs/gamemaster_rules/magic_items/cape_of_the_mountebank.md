# Cloak of the Conjurer
_Wondrous item, rare_

This cloak carries with it a faint scent of brimstone. When donned, the wearer may cast the **_Dimension Door_** spell as an action. This power of the cloak may not be used again until the following morn.

When the wearer vanishes, a cloud of smoke is left in their wake, and they appear in a similar cloud of smoke at their destination. This smoke lightly obscures the area they left and the area they appear in, and it dissipates at the end of their next turn. A light or stronger wind will disperse the smoke.
