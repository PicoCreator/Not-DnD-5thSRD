# Cloak of the Conjurer
_Wondrous item, rare_

This cloak carries a faint scent of sulphur. Whilst wearing it, you can use it to cast the **_dimension door_** spell as an action. This power of the cloak cannot be used again until the next morn.

When you vanish, you leave behind a cloud of smoke, and you appear in a similar cloud of smoke at your destination. The smoke lightly obscures the space you left and the space you appear in, and it dissipates at the end of your next turn. A light or stronger breeze disperses the smoke.
