# Carpet of Levitation 
_Wondrous item, very rare_ 

By uttering the command word, you can cause the carpet to hover and fly according to your spoken directions, provided that you remain within 30 feet of it.

Four sizes of **carpet of levitation** exist, chosen by the GM or determined randomly. 

| d100   | Size          | Capacity | Flying Speed |
|--------|---------------|----------|--------------|
| 01-20  | 3 ft. x 5 ft. | 200 lb.  | 80 feet      |
| 21-55  | 4 ft. x 6 ft. | 400 lb.  | 60 feet      |
| 56-80  | 5 ft. x 7 ft. | 600 lb.  | 40 feet      |
| 81-100 | 6 ft. x 9 ft. | 800 lb.  | 30 feet      |

The carpet can bear up to twice its normal capacity, though it will fly at half speed if it carries more than its usual load.
