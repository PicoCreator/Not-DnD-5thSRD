# Censer of Commanding Aerial Elementals
_A wondrous item of rare power_

When the incense within this censer is lit, you may use an action to utter its command word and summon an air elemental, as if you had cast the **_Conjure Elemental_** spell. The censer cannot be used again until the following morn.

This vessel, measuring six inches in width and one foot in height, is shaped like a chalice with a decorated lid. It weighs one pound.
