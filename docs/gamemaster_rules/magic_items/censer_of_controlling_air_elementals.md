# Censer of Commanding Air Elementals
_Wondrous item, rare_

Whilst incense is burning in this censer, you may use an action to speak the censer's command word and summon an air elemental, as if you had cast the **_conjure elemental_** spell. The censer cannot be used this way again until the next morn.

This 6-inch-wide, 1-foot-high vessel resembles a chalice with a decorated lid. It weighs 1 pound.
