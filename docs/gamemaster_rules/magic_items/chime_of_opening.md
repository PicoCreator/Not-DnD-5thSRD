# Chime of Unbinding
_Wondrous item, rare_

This hollow metal tube is about a foot in length and weighs a single pound. When wielded as an action, the wielder can point it at an object within 120 feet of them that can be opened, such as a door, lid, or lock. Upon striking the chime, a clear tone is emitted and one lock or latch on the object will open, unless the sound cannot reach the object. If no locks or latches remain, the object itself will open.

The chime can be used ten times before it cracks and becomes useless.
