# Chime of Unsealing
_Wondrous item, rare_

This hollow metal tube is about a foot in length and weighs a single pound. By taking an action and pointing it at an object within 120 feet, such as a door, lid, or lock, one can strike the chime and it will issue a clear tone. This will cause one lock or latch on the object to open, unless the sound cannot reach the object. If there are no locks or latches left, the object itself will open.

The chime can be used ten times before it cracks and becomes useless.
