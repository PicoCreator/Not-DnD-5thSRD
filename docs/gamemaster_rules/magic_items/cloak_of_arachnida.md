# Cloak of the Arachnid
_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

This fine garment is crafted from the finest black silk, interwoven with delicate strands of silver. When donned, the wearer is granted the following benefits:

* Immunity to the venom of poisonous creatures.
* The ability to scale walls and ceilings with the same ease as walking on the ground.
* Immunity to the webs of spiders and other such creatures, and the ability to move through webs as if they were nothing more than a minor obstacle.
* The ability to cast the **_web_** spell (save DC 13) with a mere thought. The web created by this spell will fill twice its normal area. This power can only be used once per day, and will not be available again until the following dawn.
