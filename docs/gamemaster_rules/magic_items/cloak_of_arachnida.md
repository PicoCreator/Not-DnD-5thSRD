# Cloak of the Spider
_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

This fine garment is crafted from black silk, interwoven with delicate silver threads. When worn, the following benefits are bestowed:

* You are resistant to poison damage.
* You can climb at the same speed as you can walk.
* You can traverse vertical surfaces and ceilings, leaving your hands free.
* You cannot be ensnared by webs of any kind, and can move through them as if they were difficult terrain.
* You can use an action to cast the **_web_** spell (save DC 13). The web created by the spell fills twice its normal area. This property of the cloak cannot be used again until the next dawn.
