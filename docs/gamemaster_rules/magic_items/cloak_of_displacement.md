# Mantle of Misplacement
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

Whilst you don this mantle, it casts an illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place far from your actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on their attempts to strike you. If you suffer any harm, the enchantment ceases to function until the commencement of your next turn. This enchantment is suppressed whilst you are incapacitated, bound, or otherwise unable to move.
