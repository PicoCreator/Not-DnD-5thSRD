# Cloak of the Wise
_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

Whilst wearing this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom (Perception) checks made to detect you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to conceal yourself, as the cloak's hue shifts to blend in with your surroundings. To raise or lower the hood requires an action.
