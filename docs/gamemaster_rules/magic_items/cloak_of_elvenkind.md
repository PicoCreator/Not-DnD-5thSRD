# Cloak of Elvenkind
_A wondrous item of uncommon rarity, requiring attunement_

When donning this cloak and raising its hood, one's Wisdom (Perception) checks are hindered, while Dexterity (Stealth) checks are bolstered, as the cloak's hue shifts to blend in with its surroundings. To raise or lower the hood requires an action.
