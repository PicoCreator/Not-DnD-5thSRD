# Cloak of the Bat
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

Whilst wearing this cloak, you have an advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In a dimly lit or dark area, you can grip the edges of the cloak with both hands and use it to fly at a speed of 40 feet. If you ever fail to grip the cloak's edges while flying in this way, or if you are no longer in dim light or darkness, you lose this flying speed.

Whilst wearing the cloak in a dimly lit or dark area, you can use your action to cast polymorph on yourself, transforming into a bat. Whilst in the form of the bat, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The cloak cannot be used this way again until the next dawn.
