# Mantle of the Nocturnal
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

Whilst wearing this mantle, you are granted an advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In a realm of twilight or darkness, you may clasp the edges of the mantle with both hands and soar through the air at a speed of 40 feet. Should you ever fail to grip the mantle's edges while flying in this manner, or if you are no longer in a realm of twilight or darkness, you shall lose this flying speed.

Whilst wearing the mantle in a realm of twilight or darkness, you may use your action to cast a spell of transformation upon yourself, transforming into a bat. Whilst in the form of the bat, your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores remain unchanged. The mantle cannot be used in this manner again until the next dawn.
