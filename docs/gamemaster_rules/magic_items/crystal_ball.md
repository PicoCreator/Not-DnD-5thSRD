# Mystic Orb
_A wondrous item of great power, of rare or legendary quality (requires attunement)_

The typical **Mystic Orb**, a rare item, is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the **_Divination_** spell (save DC 17) with it.

The following **Mystic Orb** variants are legendary items and have additional properties.

**Mystic Orb of Mind Reading.** You can use an action to cast the **_Detect Thoughts_** spell (save DC 17) while you are divining with the **Mystic Orb**, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this **_Detect Thoughts_** to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if **_Divination_** ends.

**Mystic Orb of Telepathy.** While divining with the Mystic Orb, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also use an action to cast the **_Suggestion_** spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this **_Suggestion_** to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if **_Divination_** ends. Once used, the **_Suggestion_** power of the Mystic Orb can't be used again until the next dawn.

**Mystic Orb of True Seeing.** While divining with the Mystic Orb, you have truesight with a radius of 120 feet centered on the spell's sensor.
