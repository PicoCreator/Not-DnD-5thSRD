# The Mystic Cube of Force 
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_ 

This cube is a small, yet powerful object, measuring an inch across. Each of its faces is adorned with a unique marking, which can be pressed with an action. The cube is imbued with 36 charges, and it regains 1d20 expended charges daily at the break of dawn.

When one of the cube's faces is pressed, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on the user, and follows them wherever they go. It will remain active for 1 minute, or until the user presses the cube's sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges. The effect of the barrier can be changed by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.

If the user's movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that cannot pass through the cube, they will not be able to move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains. The number of charges expended for each face is shown in the table below.

| Face | Charges | Effect                                                                                                            |
|------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | 1       | Gases, wind, and fog are unable to pass through the barrier.                                                      |
| 2    | 2       | Nonliving matter is unable to pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at will.      |
| 3    | 3       | Living matter is unable to pass through the barrier.                                                              |
| 4    | 4       | Spell effects are unable to pass through the barrier.                                                             |
| 5    | 5       | Nothing is able to pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at will.               |
| 6    | 0       | The barrier deactivates.                                                                                         |

The cube loses charges when the barrier is targeted by certain spells or comes into contact with certain spell or magic item effects, as shown in the table below. 

| Spell or item       | Charges Lost |
|---------------------|--------------|
| _Disintegrate_      | 1d12         |
| _Horn of blasting_  | 1d10         |
| _Passwall_          | 1d6          |
| _Prismatic spray_   | 1d20         |
| _Wall of fire_      | 1d4          |
