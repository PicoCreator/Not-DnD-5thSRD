# Mystic Portal 
_Enchanted relic, legendary_ 

This cube is 3 inches across and emits a powerful magical aura. Its six sides are each attuned to a different realm, one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to realms determined by the GM.

You can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the **_gate_** spell with it, opening a portal to the realm attuned to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can cast the **_plane shift_** spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to the realm attuned to that side.

The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
