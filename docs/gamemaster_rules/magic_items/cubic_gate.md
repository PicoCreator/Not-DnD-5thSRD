# Cubic Portal
_Wondrous item, legendary_

This cube is 3 inches across and emits a powerful magical aura. Its six sides are each linked to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other planes are determined by the GM.

You can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the **_gate_** spell, opening a portal to the plane connected to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can cast the **_plane shift_** spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to the plane linked to that side.

The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
