# Dagger of Venom
_Weapon (dagger), rare_

You are granted a boon of +1 to your attack and damage rolls when wielding this enchanted weapon.

By taking an action, you can cause the blade to be coated in a thick, black poison. This poison will remain for one minute, or until an attack with this weapon strikes a creature. The creature must pass a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, or suffer 2d10 poison damage and become poisoned for one minute. The dagger cannot be used in this manner again until the next dawn.
