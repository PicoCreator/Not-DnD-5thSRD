You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon.

You can use an action to cause a thick, black poison to coat the blade. This poison will remain for one minute or until an attack using this weapon strikes a creature. That creature must pass a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become poisoned for one minute. The dagger cannot be used in this manner again until the next dawn.
