# Dancing Blade
Weapon (any sword), exceedingly rare (requires attunement)

You may use a bonus action to hurl this enchanted blade into the air and utter the command word. Upon doing so, the sword will begin to hover, soaring up to 30 feet, and assail a creature of your choosing within 5 feet of it. The sword utilizes your attack roll and ability score modifier to determine the damage inflicted.

Whilst the blade hovers, you may use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you may direct the sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.

After the hovering sword has attacked four times, it will attempt to return to your hand by flying up to 30 feet. If you have no hand free, it will drop to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no clear path to you, it will move as close to you as possible and then fall to the ground. It will also cease to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.
