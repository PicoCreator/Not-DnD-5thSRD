# Dancing Blade
Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)

You can use a bonus action to hurl this magical blade into the air and utter the command word. Upon doing so, the blade will begin to hover, flying up to 30 feet and attacking one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The blade uses your attack roll and ability score modifier for damage rolls.

Using a bonus action, you can cause the blade to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the blade to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.

After the hovering blade has attacked four times, it will attempt to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it will fall to the ground at your feet. If the blade has no unobstructed path to you, it will move as close to you as it can and then fall to the ground. It will also cease to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.
