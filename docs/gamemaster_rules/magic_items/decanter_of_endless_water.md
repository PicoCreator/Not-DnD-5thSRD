# The Chalice of Abundant Waters
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This ornate goblet is filled with a mysterious liquid that sloshes when shaken. It weighs 2 pounds.

You can use an action to remove the lid and speak one of three command words, whereupon a stream of fresh or salt water (your choice) will pour forth from the chalice. The water will cease to flow at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following options:

* "Trickle" produces 1 gallon of water.
* "Torrent" produces 5 gallons of water.
* "Deluge" produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a powerful torrent 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action while holding the chalice, you can direct the deluge at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. Alternatively, you can target an object that isn't being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you.
