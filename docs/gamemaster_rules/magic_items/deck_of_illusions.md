# Deck of Illusions 
_A wondrous item of uncommon rarity_ 

This box contains a set of parchment cards, with a full deck containing 34 cards. When found as treasure, it is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.

The magic of the deck is only activated when cards are drawn at random. An action must be taken to draw a card from the deck and throw it to the ground within 30 feet of the user.

Upon the card being thrown, an illusion of one or more creatures will appear and remain until dispelled. The illusion appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature, though it cannot cause any harm. As long as the user is within 120 feet of the illusion and can see it, they can use an action to move it magically within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusion will reveal it to be an illusion, as objects will pass through it. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check will also identify the illusion as such, and it will appear translucent.

The illusion will remain until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card will disappear, and the card cannot be used again.
