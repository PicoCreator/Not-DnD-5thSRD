# Deck of Illusions 
_Wondrous item, uncommon_ 

This box holds a set of parchment cards, usually containing 34 cards, though a deck found as treasure may be missing 1d20 − 1 cards.

To activate the magic of the deck, one must draw a card at random and cast it to the ground within 30 feet. An illusion of one or more creatures will appear over the card and remain until dispelled. The illusion appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature, though it can do no harm. As long as one is within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, they can use an action to move it magically within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature will reveal it to be an illusion, as objects pass through it. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check will also identify the creature as illusory, and it will appear translucent.

The illusion will end when its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can no longer be used.

The Deck of Illusions is a wondrous item of uncommon rarity. It contains a set of parchment cards, usually 34 in total, though a deck found as treasure may be missing 1d20 − 1 cards. To activate the magic of the deck, one must draw a card at random and cast it to the ground within 30 feet.

An illusion of one or more creatures will appear over the card and remain until dispelled. The illusion appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature, though it can do no harm. As long as one is within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, they can use an action to move it magically within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature will reveal it to be an illusion, as objects pass through it. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check will also identify the creature as illusory, and it will appear translucent.

The illusion will end when its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can no longer be used. The following table shows the illusions associated with each card:
