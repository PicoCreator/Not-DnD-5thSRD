Name: Deck of Many Wonders
Type: Item

This wondrous item is a deck of cards, each of which contains a mysterious and powerful magical effect. When a creature draws a card from the deck, they must immediately suffer the effect of the card, for better or for worse. The effects of the cards range from great fortune to dire misfortune, and can even cause death. It is said that the deck contains a great power, and those who draw from it must be prepared to accept the consequences of their actions.
# The Deck of Many Wonders 
_A wondrous item of legend_

Often found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards crafted from ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks contain only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.

Before drawing a card, one must declare how many cards they intend to draw and then draw them randomly (an altered deck of playing cards can be used to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. As soon as a card is drawn from the deck, its magic takes effect. Each card must be drawn no more than one hour after the previous draw. If the chosen number of cards is not drawn, the remaining cards will fly from the deck and take effect all at once.

Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card will reappear in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.

*Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards 

**Balance.** Your mind is thrown into disarray, causing your alignment to be reversed. If you are of a neutral or unaligned nature, this card has no effect.

**Comet.** Should you be able to vanquish the next hostile creature or group of creatures you come across, you shall be rewarded with experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.

**Donjon.** You are suddenly transported away and placed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. All that you were wearing and carrying is left behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and released from the sphere. No divination magic can locate you, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You shall draw no more cards.

**Euryale.** The card's medusa-like visage curses you, and you are burdened with a âˆ’2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.

**The Fates.** The fabric of reality unravels and is spun anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.

**Flames.** A powerful devil becomes your enemy, and it seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity shall last until either you or the devil is no more.

**Fool.** You shall lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.

**Gem.** Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each shall appear at your feet.

**Idiot.** Your Intelligence is permanently reduced by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.

**Jester.** You shall gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.

**Key.** A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient shall appear in your hands. The GM shall choose the weapon.

**Knight.** You shall gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who shall appear in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter shall be of the same race as you and shall serve you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You shall control this character.

**Moon.** You are granted the ability to cast the **_wish_** spell 1d3 times.

**Rogue.** A nonplayer character of the GM's choice shall become hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy shall not be known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a **_wish_** spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.

**Ruin.** All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, shall be lost to you. Portable property shall vanish. Businesses, buildings, and land you own shall be lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card shall also disappear.

**Skull.** You shall summon an avatar of death--a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It shall appear in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and shall attack you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar shall fight until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it shall disappear. If anyone attempts to aid you, the helper shall summon their own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death cannot be restored to life.

**Turning Immunity.** The Avatar is immune to features that turn undead. 

#### Actions 
**Reaping Scythe.** The Avatar sweeps its spectral scythe through a creature within 5 feet of it, dealing 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage. 


**Star.** Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.    
**Sun.** You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the GM determines randomly) appears in your hands.    
**Talons.** Every magic item you wear or carry is disintegrated. Artifacts in your possession are not destroyed, but do vanish.    
**Throne.** You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.    
**Vizier.** At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.    
**The Void.** This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.
