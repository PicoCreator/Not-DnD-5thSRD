# Defender 
_Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)_ 

When you wield this magical blade, you are granted a +3 bonus to your attack and damage rolls.

On each of your turns, you may choose to transfer some or all of the sword's bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, so long as you maintain a firm grip on the sword.
