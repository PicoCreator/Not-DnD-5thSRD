# Defender 
_Weapon (any blade), legendary (requires attunement)_ 

You gain a +3 bonus to your attack and damage rolls when using this magical weapon.

The first time you attack with the blade on each of your turns, you can choose to transfer some or all of the sword's bonus to your Armour Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, as long as you hold the blade to gain a bonus to AC from it.
