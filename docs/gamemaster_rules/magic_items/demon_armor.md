# Knight's Aegis
_Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)_

Whilst wearing this armor, you are granted a +1 bonus to your Armor Class, and you can comprehend and converse in the language of the Ancients. Furthermore, the armor's gauntlets, adorned with claws, transform your unarmed strikes into magical weapons that deal slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls, and a damage die of 1d8.

**Curse.** Once you don this cursed armor, you can not remove it unless you are the target of the **_remove curse_** spell or similar magic. Whilst wearing the armor, you are at a disadvantage when making attack rolls against creatures of the netherworld, and when making saving throws against their spells and special abilities.
