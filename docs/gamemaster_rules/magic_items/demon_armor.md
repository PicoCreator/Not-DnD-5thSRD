# Demon Plate
_Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)_

Whilst wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak the language of the abyss. Furthermore, the armor's clawed gauntlets turn unarmed strikes with your hands into magical weapons that deal slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and a damage die of 1d8.

**Curse.** Once you don this cursed armor, you can't take it off unless you are targeted by the **_remove curse_** spell or similar magic. Whilst wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.
