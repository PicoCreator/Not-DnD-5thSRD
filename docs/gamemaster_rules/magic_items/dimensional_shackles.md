# Chains of the Aether
_Wondrous item, rare_

By expending an action, these chains may be placed upon an incapacitated creature. The chains adjust to fit any creature of Small to Large size. In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the chains prevent the creature bound by them from using any form of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. However, the chains do not impede the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.

You and any creature you designate when you use the chains can use an action to remove them. Once every thirty days, the bound creature may attempt a Strength (Athletics) check with a DC of 30. On success, the creature breaks free and the chains are destroyed.
