# Chains of the Dimension
_Wondrous item, rare_

By using an action, these chains can be placed upon an incapacitated creature. The chains adjust to fit any creature of Small to Large size. In addition to being mundane manacles, the chains prevent the creature from using any form of extradimensional movement, such as teleportation or travelling to a different plane of existence. However, the creature can still pass through interdimensional portals.

You and any creature you designate when using the chains can use an action to remove them. Every 30 days, the bound creature can attempt a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On success, the creature breaks free and the chains are destroyed.
