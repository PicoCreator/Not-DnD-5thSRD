# Dragon Scale Mail 
_Armor (scale mail), very rare (requires attunement)_ 

Dragon scale mail is crafted from the scales of a single dragon, sometimes gifted to humanoids by the dragon itself, or else carefully skinned and preserved from a slain dragon. This armor is highly sought after, and provides its wearer with a +1 bonus to AC, advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and resistance to one damage type determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).

Furthermore, the wearer can focus their senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon of the same type as the armor, within 30 miles. This special action can only be used once, and must be renewed at the next dawn. 

| Dragon | Resistance  |
|--------|-------------|
| Black  | Acid        |
| Blue   | Lightning  |
| Brass  | Fire        |
| Bronze | Lightning  |
| Copper | Acid        |
| Gold   | Fire        |
| Green  | Poison      |
| Red    | Fire        |
| Silver | Cold        |
| White  | Cold        |
