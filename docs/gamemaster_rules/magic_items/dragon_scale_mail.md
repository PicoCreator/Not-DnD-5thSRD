Name: Dragon Scale Hauberk
Type: Armor

# Dragon Scale Hauberk
_Armor (scale mail), very rare (requires attunement)_

Dragon scale hauberk is crafted from the scales of a single type of dragon. In some cases, dragons will collect their cast-off scales and bestow them upon humanoids. In other cases, hunters will carefully skin and preserve the hide of a slain dragon. In either case, dragon scale hauberk is highly prized.

Whilst wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).

Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action can't be used again until the next morn.

| Dragon | Resistance  |
|--------|-------------|
| Black  | Acid        |
| Blue   | Lightning  |
| Brass  | Fire        |
| Bronze | Lightning  |
| Copper | Acid        |
| Gold   | Fire        |
| Green  | Poison      |
| Red    | Fire        |
| Silver | Cold        |
