# Powder of Vanishment
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This powder is found in a small packet and looks like very fine sand. It can be used once. When you use an action to throw the powder into the air, you and all creatures and objects within 10 feet of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all affected, and the powder is consumed when its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the powder attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature.
