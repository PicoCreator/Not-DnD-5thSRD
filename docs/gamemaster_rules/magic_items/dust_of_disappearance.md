# Powder of Vanishment
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This fine powder is contained within a small packet, and is enough for a single use. When a user casts the powder into the air with an action, they and all creatures and objects within 10 feet of them become invisible for 2d4 minutes. All affected by the powder are cloaked in the same duration, and the powder is consumed when its enchantment takes effect. If a creature affected by the powder attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility is broken for that creature.
