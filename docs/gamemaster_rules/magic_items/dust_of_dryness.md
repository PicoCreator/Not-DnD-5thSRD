# Powder of Desiccation
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This small packet contains a generous helping of powder, enough for 1d6 + 4 pinches. With an action, one can sprinkle a pinch of the powder over a body of water, transforming it into a single marble-sized pellet that floats or rests near the point of sprinkling. The pellet is so light that it is almost imperceptible.

Should one wish to, they can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, releasing the water that the powder had absorbed. Doing so will end the pellet's magical properties.

Any elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the powder must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, or suffer 10d6 necrotic damage upon failure, or half as much upon success.
