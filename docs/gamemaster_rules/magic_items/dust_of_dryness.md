# Powder of Desiccation
_Wondrous Item, Uncommon_

This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of powder. An action can be used to sprinkle a pinch of it over a body of water. The powder will transform a cube of water 15 feet on a side into a single marble-sized pellet, which will either float or rest near where the powder was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible.

An action can be used to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing it to shatter and release the water it had absorbed. Doing so will end the pellet's magical properties.

An elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the powder must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
