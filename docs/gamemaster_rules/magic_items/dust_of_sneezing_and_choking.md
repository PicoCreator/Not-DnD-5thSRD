# Powder of Wheezing and Choking
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

Found in a small container, this powder resembles the finest of sands. An **_identify_** spell reveals it to be a **powder of disappearance**, with enough for a single use.

When an action is taken to cast a handful of the powder into the air, all creatures within 30 feet of you that require air must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while wheezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The **_lesser restoration_** spell can also end the effect on a creature.
