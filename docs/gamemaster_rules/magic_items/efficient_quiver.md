# Efficient Quiver 
_Wondrous Item, Uncommon_ 

This quiver has three compartments, each of which is connected to an extradimensional space. This allows the quiver to hold a great many items, yet never weigh more than two pounds. The smallest compartment can hold up to sixty arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The middle-sized compartment can hold up to eighteen javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment can hold up to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears. 

You can draw any item from the quiver as if it were a regular quiver or scabbard.
