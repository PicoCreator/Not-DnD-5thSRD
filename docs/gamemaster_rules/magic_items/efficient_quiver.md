# Efficient Quiver
_A wondrous item of uncommon quality_

This quiver is a marvel of engineering, for it is able to contain a vast array of items, yet never weighs more than two pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment can contain up to eighteen javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment can hold up to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears.

The quiver's contents can be drawn forth as if from a regular quiver or scabbard, allowing for quick and easy access to the items within.
