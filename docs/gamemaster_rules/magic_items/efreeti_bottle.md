# Bottle of the Efreeti
_A wondrous item of great rarity_

This bottle of painted brass weighs a single pound. When one uses an action to remove the stopper, a thick cloud of smoke billows forth from the bottle. At the end of the turn, the smoke dissipates in a harmless flash of fire, and an efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the user.

The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.
