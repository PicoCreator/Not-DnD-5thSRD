# Genie Bottle 
_Wondrous item, very rare_ 

This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke dissipates with a flash of harmless fire, and a genie appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.

| 01-10 | The genie attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the genie disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.       |
| 11-90 | The genie serves you for 1 hour, doing as you command. Then the genie returns to the bottle, and a new stopper seals it. The stopper can't be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the genie escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. |
| 91-00 |  The genie can cast the wish spell three times for you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic. |
