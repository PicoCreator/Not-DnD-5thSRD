# Everburning Flask
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

A thick plume of smoke billows from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass flask, which weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of dense smoke spreads out in a 60-foot radius from the flask. The area is heavily obscured. Each minute the flask remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum radius of 120 feet.

The cloud persists as long as the flask is open. To close the flask, you must speak its command word as an action. Once the flask is closed, the cloud dissipates after 10 minutes. A moderate breeze (11 to 20 miles per hour) can disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.
