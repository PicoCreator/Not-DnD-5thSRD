# Everburning Flask
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

A lead-stoppered brass flask, weighing one pound, emits a cloud of thick smoke from its mouth when the stopper is removed. The smoke spreads in a 60-foot radius, heavily obscuring the area. Every minute the flask remains open, the radius increases by 10 feet, up to a maximum of 120 feet.

The cloud persists as long as the flask is open. To close the flask, one must speak its command word as an action. Once the flask is closed, the cloud dissipates after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.
