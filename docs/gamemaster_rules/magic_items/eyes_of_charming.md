# Charms of Enchantment
_A wondrous item of uncommon rarity, requiring attunement_

These crystalline lenses fit snugly over the eyes. They are imbued with three charges, and when worn, one may expend a single charge as an action to cast the **_Charm Person_** spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet, provided both the caster and the target can see one another. The Charms of Enchantment are restored to full power each day at the break of dawn.
