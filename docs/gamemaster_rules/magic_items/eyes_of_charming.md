# Charms of Enchantment
_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. When worn, one may expend a charge as an action to cast the **_charm person_** spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of them, provided that they and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.
