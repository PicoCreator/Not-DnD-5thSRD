# Eyes of Minute Perception
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

These crystalline lenses fit snugly over the eyes, granting the wearer an enhanced sight. When donned, one can see with greater clarity than normal, out to a range of one foot. Those who wear these lenses gain an advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight when searching an area or studying an object within that range.
