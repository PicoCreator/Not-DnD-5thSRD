# Eyes of Minute Perception
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. When worn, they grant the wearer the ability to see much better than normal out to a range of one foot. Those wearing them gain advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight when searching an area or studying an object within that range.
