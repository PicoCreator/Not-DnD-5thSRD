# Quill of the Phoenix
_Wondrous item, rare_

This small object appears to be a feather, but upon closer inspection, it is revealed to be a quill of the phoenix. Different types of quills exist, each with a unique single-use effect. The GM chooses the kind of quill or determines it randomly. 

| d100  | Quill of the Phoenix |
|-------|----------------------|
| 01-20 | Anchor               |
| 21-35 | Avian                |
| 36-50 | Fanfare              |
| 51-65 | Swan Boat            |
| 66-90 | Tree                 |
| 91-00 | Whip                 |

**Anchor.** You may use an action to touch the quill to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel shall remain unmoved by any means. Touching the quill to the vessel again shall end the effect. When the effect ends, the quill shall vanish.

**Avian.** You may use an action to toss the quill 5 feet into the air. The quill shall disappear and an enormous, multicolored bird shall take its place. The bird shall have the statistics of a roc, but it shall obey your simple commands and shall not attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird shall vanish after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You may dismiss the bird as an action.

**Fanfare.** If you are on a boat or ship, you may use an action to toss the quill up to 10 feet in the air. The quill shall disappear, and a giant flapping fan shall take its place. The fan shall float and create a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You may dismiss the fan as an action.

**Swan Boat.** You may use an action to touch the quill to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The quill shall disappear, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot- wide boat shaped like a swan shall take its place. The boat shall be self-propelled and shall move across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You may use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature shall count as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature shall count as nine. The boat shall remain for 24 hours and then shall vanish. You may dismiss the boat as an action.

**Tree.** You must be outdoors to use this quill. You may use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The quill shall disappear, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree shall spring into existence. The tree shall be 60 feet tall and have a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top shall spread out in a 20-foot radius.

**Whip.** You may use an action to throw the quill to a point within 10 feet of you. The quill shall disappear, and a floating whip shall take its place. You may then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target shall take 1d6 + 5 force damage.

As a bonus action on your turn, you may direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip shall vanish after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die.
