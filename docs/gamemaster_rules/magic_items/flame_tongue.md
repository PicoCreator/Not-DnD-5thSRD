# Burning Blade
_Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)_

By uttering the command word, you can cause a blaze to erupt from the blade. This flame casts bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. When the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it strikes. The flames will remain until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.
