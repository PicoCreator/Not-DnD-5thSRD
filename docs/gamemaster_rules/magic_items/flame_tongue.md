# Flaming Blade 
_Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)_ 

By uttering the ancient command word, you can cause the blade to burst into flames. These flames illuminate the area in a brilliant light, radiating 40 feet in all directions. When the sword is ablaze, it deals an additional 2d6 fire damage to any foe it strikes. The flames will remain until you speak the command word again or until you sheathe or drop the sword.
