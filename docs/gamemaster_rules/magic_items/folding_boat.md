# Grand Galleon 
_A wondrous item of grandeur, rare_ 

This object appears as a wooden box of grand proportions, measuring twelve inches in length, six inches in width, and six inches in depth. It weighs four pounds and is buoyant enough to float atop the water. It can be opened to store items within. This item also has three command words, each requiring an action to be spoken.

The first command word causes the box to unfold into a boat of ten feet in length, four feet in width, and two feet in depth. The boat is equipped with a pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. It can comfortably accommodate four Medium-sized creatures.

The second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship of twenty-four feet in length, eight feet in width, and six feet in depth. The ship is equipped with a deck, rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. It can comfortably accommodate fifteen Medium-sized creatures.

When the box is transformed into a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel of its size, and any items stored within the box remain in the boat.

The third command word causes the Grand Galleon to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that cannot fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.
