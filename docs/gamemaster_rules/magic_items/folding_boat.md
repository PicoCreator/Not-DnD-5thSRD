# Folded Boat
_A wondrous item, rare_

This object appears as a wooden box, measuring 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring an action to be spoken.

The first command word causes the box to unfold into a boat, 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. It is equipped with a pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. It can comfortably hold four Medium creatures.

The second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship, 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. It has a deck, rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. It can comfortably hold fifteen Medium creatures.

When the box is transformed into a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and any items stored in the box remain in the boat.

The third command word causes the **folded boat** to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that cannot fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.
