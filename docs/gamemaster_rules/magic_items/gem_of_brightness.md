# Gem of Splendour
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This prism holds fifty charges of magical energy. When held, one may use an action to speak one of three command words, each of which will cause a different effect:

* The first command word causes the gem to emit a brilliant light in a thirty-foot radius, and dim light for an additional thirty feet. This effect does not expend a charge, and will remain until the command word is spoken again or another effect is used.

* The second command word expends one charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature within sixty feet. The creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for one minute. The creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

* The third command word expends five charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a thirty-foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.

When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth fifty gold pieces.
