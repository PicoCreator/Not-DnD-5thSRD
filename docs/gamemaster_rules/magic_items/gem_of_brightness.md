# Gem of Illumination
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This prism holds 50 charges. When held, one may use an action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:

* The first command word causes the gem to emit bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect does not expend a charge and will remain until a bonus action is used to repeat the command word or another function of the gem is used.
* The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature seen within 60 feet. The creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
* The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.

When all of the gem's charges are used up, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.
