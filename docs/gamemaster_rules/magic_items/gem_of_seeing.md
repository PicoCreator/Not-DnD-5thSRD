# Gem of Sight
_A wondrous item of rare power, requiring attunement_

This gem is imbued with three charges. By speaking its command word and expending one charge, the user may gain the power of true sight for a period of ten minutes. This sight extends out to a distance of 120 feet when peering through the gem.

At the dawn of each day, the gem regains one to three of its expended charges.
