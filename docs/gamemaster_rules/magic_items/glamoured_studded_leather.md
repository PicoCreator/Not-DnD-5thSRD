With a bonus action, one may utter the armor's command word and cause it to take on the guise of a common set of clothing or some other form of armor. The wearer may decide the color, style, and any other adornments, yet the armor shall remain of its original weight and bulk. This illusion shall remain until the wearer uses this property again or removes the armor.
