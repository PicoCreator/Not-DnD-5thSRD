# Gilded Studded Leather
_Armour (studded leather), rare_

Whilst wearing this armour, ye shall gain a +1 bonus to thy AC. Ye can also use a bonus action to speak the armour's command word and cause the armour to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of armour. Thou shalt decide what it looks like, including colour, style, and accessories, but the armour retains its normal bulk and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until thou usest this property again or removest the armour.
