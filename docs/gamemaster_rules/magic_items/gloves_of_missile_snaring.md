# Gauntlets of Missile Deflection
_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

These gauntlets feel as if they were made for your hands when you don them. When a ranged weapon attack strikes you while wearing them, you may use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.
