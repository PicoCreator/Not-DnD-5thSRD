# Hammer of Thunderbolts 
_Weapon (maul), legendary_ 

You are granted a boon of +1 to your attack and damage rolls when wielding this magical weapon.

**Giant's Bane (Requires Attunement)**. To attune to this weapon, you must don a **belt of giant strength** (any variety) and **gauntlets of ogre power**. Should you remove either of these items, the attunement will be broken. While attuned to this weapon and holding it, your Strength score will be increased by 4, up to a maximum of 20, but not beyond. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a giant, the giant must pass a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be slain.

The hammer also holds 5 charges. While attuned to it, you may expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the hammer, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack is successful, the hammer will unleash a thunderous clap that can be heard up to 300 feet away. The target and all creatures within 30 feet of it must pass a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. The hammer will regain 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.
