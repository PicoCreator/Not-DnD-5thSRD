# Hammer of Thunderbolts 
_Weapon (maul), legendary_ 

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon.

**Giant's Bane (Requires Attunement)**. To attune to this weapon, you must be wearing a **belt of giant strength** (any variety) and **gauntlets of ogre power**. If you take off either of these items, the attunement ends. When you are attuned to this weapon and holding it, your Strength score increases by 4 and can exceed 20, but not 30. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a giant, the giant must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be slain.

The hammer also has 5 charges. When attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the hammer, throwing it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the hammer unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. The hammer regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.
