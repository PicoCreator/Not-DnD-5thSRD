# The Glorious Blade 
_Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement by a paladin)_ 

You are granted a +3 bonus to your attack and damage rolls when wielding this magical weapon. When you strike a fiend or an undead with it, they take an additional 2d10 radiant damage.

As long as you hold the drawn sword, it creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around you. You and all creatures friendly to you within the aura are granted advantage on their saving throws against spells and other magical effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius of the aura increases to 30 feet.
