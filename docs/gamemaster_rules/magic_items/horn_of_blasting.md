# Horn of Blasting 
_Wondrous item, rare_ 

By uttering the command word and blowing the horn, a thunderous blast is unleashed in a 30-foot cone that can be heard from 600 feet away. All creatures within the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Those who fail the save suffer 5d6 thunder damage and are deafened for 1 minute. Those who succeed take half the damage and are not deafened. Those made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.

The use of the horn's magic carries a 20 percent chance of causing it to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.
