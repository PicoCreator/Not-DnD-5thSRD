Name: Horn of Valhalla
Type: Item

# Horn of Valhalla
_Wondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), or legendary (iron)_

By taking an action, one may blow this horn and call forth warrior spirits from Valhalla. These spirits, taking the form of berserkers, will appear within a radius of 60 feet and remain for an hour or until they are reduced to 0 hit points. After the horn is used, it cannot be used again until seven days have passed.

Four types of Horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each crafted from a different metal. The type of horn determines the number of berserkers summoned and the requirement for its use. The GM may choose the type of horn or determine it randomly.

| d100  | Horn Type | Berserkers Summoned | Requirement |
|-------|-----------|--------------------|-------------|
| 01-40 | Silver    | 2d4 + 2            | None        |
| 41-75 | Brass     | 3d4 + 3            | Proficiency with all simple weapons |
| 76-90 | Bronze    | 4d4 + 4            | Proficiency with all medium armor   |
| 91-00 | Iron      | 5d4 + 5            | Proficiency with all martial weapons|

If the requirement for the horn's use is not met, the summoned berserkers will attack the user. If the requirement is met, the berserkers will be friendly to the user and their companions, and will obey their commands.
