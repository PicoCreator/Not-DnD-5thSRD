Name: Horn of the Ancients
Type: Item

# Horn of the Ancients
_Wondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), or legendary (iron)_

You can use an action to sound this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the ancient realms appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a berserker. They return to their realm after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you sound the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

Four types of **Horn of the Ancients** are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn's type or determines it randomly. 

| d100  | Horn Type | Berserkers Summoned | Requirement Needed |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 01-40 | Silver    | 2d4 + 2             | None               |
| 41-75 | Brass     | 3d4 + 3             | Proficiency with all simple weapons |
| 76-90 | Bronze    | 4d4 + 4             | Proficiency with all medium armor   |
| 91-00 | Iron      | 5d4 + 5             | Proficiency with all martial weapons|

If you sound the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and obey your commands.
