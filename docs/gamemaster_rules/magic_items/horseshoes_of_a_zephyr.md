# The Winged Shoes of the Zephyr
_A wondrous item of great rarity_

This set of four iron horseshoes, when affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, grant the creature the ability to float four inches above the ground. This allows the creature to traverse non-solid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava, with ease. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain, and can move at normal speed for up to twelve hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a forced march.
