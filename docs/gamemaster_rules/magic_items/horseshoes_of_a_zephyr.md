# Horseshoes of the Zephyr
_Wondrous Item, Very Rare_

This set of four iron horseshoes, when affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, allows the creature to move normally while hovering four inches above the ground. This effect allows the creature to traverse non-solid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava, without leaving any tracks and ignoring difficult terrain. Furthermore, the creature can move at normal speed for up to twelve hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a forced march.
