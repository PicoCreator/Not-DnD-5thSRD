# The Swift Horseshoes
_Wondrous item, rare_

This set of four iron horseshoes, when affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, bestow upon them a remarkable increase in speed, allowing them to traverse the land with a swiftness hitherto unseen. The creature's walking speed is increased by a full 30 feet.
