# Unmovable Bar
_Bar, Uncommon_

This flat iron bar has a button on one end. By using an action, the button can be pressed, causing the bar to become magically fixed in place. Until someone else or yourself uses an action to press the button again, the bar will not move, even if it is defying gravity. The bar can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. If more weight is added, the bar will deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed bar up to 10 feet on a success.
