# Unmovable Pillar
_Pillar, uncommon_

This flat iron pillar stands tall and proud, with a button adorning one end. With a simple press of the button, the pillar becomes magically fixed in place, unmovable by any force. Not even the mightiest of winds or the strongest of creatures can move it, until the button is pressed again. The pillar can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight, and any more than that will cause it to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed pillar up to 10 feet on a success.
