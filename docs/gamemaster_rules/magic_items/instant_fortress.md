# Grand Keep
_Wondrous item, rare_

You may use an action to place this small metal cube upon the ground and utter its command word. In an instant, the cube will expand into a grand keep, standing tall until you use an action to speak the command word that will dismiss it, only if the keep is empty.

The keep is a square tower, 20 feet on each side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, connected by a ladder running along one wall, ending at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you, which opens only at your command, which you may speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the **_knock_** spell and similar magics, such as that of a **chime of opening**.

Each creature in the area where the keep appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the keep. Objects in the area that are not being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.

The tower is made of adamantine, and its magics prevent it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a **_wish_** spell can repair the keep (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of **_wish_** causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.
