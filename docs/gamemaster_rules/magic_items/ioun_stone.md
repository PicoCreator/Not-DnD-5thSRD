When one of these stones is tossed into the air, it will orbit the head of the user and grant them a special boon. To remove the stone, another creature must use an action to make a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The user can also use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.

The stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits the head.

**Absorption (Very Rare).** This pale lavender ellipsoid will orbit the head of the user, allowing them to use their reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature they can see and targeting only them.

Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it will burn out and turn dull gray, losing its magic. If the user is targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone cannot cancel it.

**Agility (Very Rare).** The user's Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits their head.

**Awareness (Rare).** The user cannot be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits their head.

**Fortitude (Very Rare).** The user's Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits their head.

**Greater Absorption (Legendary).** This marbled lavender and green ellipsoid will orbit the head of the user, allowing them to use their reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature they can see and targeting only them.

Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it will burn out and turn dull gray, losing its magic. If the user is targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone cannot cancel it.

**Insight (Very Rare).** The user's Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits their head.

**Intellect (Very Rare).** The user's Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits their head.

**Leadership (Very Rare).** The user's Charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits their head.

**Mastery (Legendary).** The user's proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits their head.

**Protection (Rare).** The user gains a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits their head.

**Regeneration (Legendary).** The user regains 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits their head, provided that they have at least 1 hit point.

**Reserve (Rare).** This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until the user uses them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 âˆ’ 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While this stone orbits the head of the user, they can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if the user cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

**Strength (Very Rare).** The user's Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits their head.

**Sustenance (Rare).** The user does not need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits their head.
