# Chains of Captivation
_Wondrous item, rare_

This rusted iron sphere, measuring 3 inches in diameter and weighing 1 pound, can be used with an action to speak the command word and be thrown at a Huge or smaller creature seen within 60 feet. As it moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.

Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained until a bonus action is taken to speak the command word again and release it. Missing with the attack or speaking the command word again causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.

A creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On success, the item is destroyed and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have passed.

Once the bands are used, they cannot be used again until the next dawn.
