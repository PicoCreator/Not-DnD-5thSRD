# Chains of Captivation
_Wondrous item, rare_

This rusted iron sphere, measuring three inches in diameter and weighing one pound, can be used to ensnare a creature of Huge size or smaller. By speaking the command word and throwing the sphere, you can make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. If the attack is successful, the target is bound in the chains until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again and release them. If the attack misses, or the command word is spoken again, the chains will contract and become a sphere once more.

A creature, including the one bound, can attempt to break the chains with a DC 20 Strength check. If successful, the item is destroyed and the creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until the next dawn.

These chains can only be used once per day, and must be used before the next dawn.
