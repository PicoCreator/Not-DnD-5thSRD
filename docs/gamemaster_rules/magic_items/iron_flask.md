# Iron Flask 
_Wondrous item, legendary_ 

This iron bottle has a brass stopper. By using an action, one can speak the flask's command word and target a creature that is within 60 feet. If the target is from a different plane of existence, the target must pass a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, they have advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, the creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can only hold one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask does not need to breathe, eat, or drink and does not age.

By using an action, one can remove the flask's stopper and release the creature inside. The creature is friendly to the user and their companions for 1 hour and will obey their commands for that duration. If the user gives no commands or commands that will likely result in the creature's death, the creature will defend itself but will not take any other actions. After the duration ends, the creature will act in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.

An **_identify_** spell will reveal that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or determined randomly.
