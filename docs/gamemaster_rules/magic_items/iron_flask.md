Name: The Mystic Flask
Type: Item

# The Mystic Flask
_Wondrous item, legendary_

This iron bottle is sealed with a brass stopper, and can be opened with a simple command. Speak the command word, and you can target a creature within 60 feet of you. If the creature is from a different plane of existence, they must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped within the flask. If the creature has been trapped before, they have advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, the creature will remain in the flask until released. The flask can only hold one creature at a time, and the creature does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while inside, nor do they age.

You can use an action to remove the stopper and release the creature within. The creature will be friendly to you and your companions for one hour, and will obey your commands during that time. If you give no commands or give a command that would likely result in their death, they will defend themselves but take no other action. After the hour is up, the creature will act in accordance with their normal disposition and alignment.

An **_identify_** spell will reveal that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered flask may already contain a creature chosen by the GM or determined randomly.
