# Javelin of Thunderous Fury
_Weapon (javelin), uncommon_

This javelin is a magical weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line five feet wide that extends out from you to a target within one hundred and twenty feet. Every creature in the line, excluding you and the target, must make a DC thirteen Dexterity saving throw, taking four d six lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus four d six lightning damage.

The javelin's property cannot be used again until the next morn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magical weapon.
