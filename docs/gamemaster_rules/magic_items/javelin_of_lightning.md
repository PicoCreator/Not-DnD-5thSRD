# Javelin of Thunder
_Weapon (javelin), uncommon_

This javelin is a magical weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of thunder, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line, excluding you and the target, must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 thunder damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The thunder bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 thunder damage.

The javelin's property cannot be used again until the next morn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magical weapon.
