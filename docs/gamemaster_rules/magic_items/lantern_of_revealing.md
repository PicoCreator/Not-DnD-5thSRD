# Lantern of Unveiling
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

When lit, this hooded lantern will burn for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, emitting a bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern's bright light. An action can be used to lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.
