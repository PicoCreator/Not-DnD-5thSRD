# The Illuminating Lantern
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

When lit, this hooded lantern will burn for six hours on a single pint of oil, radiating a brilliant light in a thirty-foot radius and a dim light for an additional thirty feet. All invisible creatures and objects will be made visible as long as they are within the lantern's bright light. An action can be used to lower the hood, reducing the light to a dim glow in a five-foot radius.
