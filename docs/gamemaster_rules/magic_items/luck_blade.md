# Blade of Fortune
_Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)_ 

The wielder of this enchanted blade is granted a boon of fortune, granting them a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. Furthermore, while the sword is in their possession, they are also granted a +1 bonus to their saving throws.

**Fortune's Favor.** If the sword is in the possession of its wielder, they may call upon its luck (no action required) to reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw that did not turn out to their liking. The wielder must accept the result of the second roll. This property cannot be used again until the following dawn.

**Wish.** The sword has 1d4 â€“ 1 charges. While holding it, its wielder may use an action to expend 1 charge and cast the **_wish_** spell from it. This property cannot be used again until the following dawn. The sword loses this property if it has no charges.
