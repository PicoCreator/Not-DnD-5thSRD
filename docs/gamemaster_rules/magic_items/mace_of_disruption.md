# Mace of Disruption 
_Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)_ 

When you strike a fiend or an undead with this magical weapon, it takes an additional 2d6 radiant damage. If the target has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it must pass a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

While you wield this weapon, it emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
