# Mace of Terror
_Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)_

This magical weapon holds three charges. When you grasp it, you can expend one charge to unleash a wave of terror. All creatures of your choice within a 30-foot radius of you must pass a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for one minute. While in this state, the creature must attempt to move away from you as far as possible, and cannot willingly move within 30 feet of you. It cannot take reactions, and for its action, it can only use the Dash action or attempt to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself if successful.

The mace regains 1d3 expended charges each day at dawn.
