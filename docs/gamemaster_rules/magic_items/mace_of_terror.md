# Mace of Terror
_Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)_

This magical weapon is imbued with a powerful enchantment. When held, one may expend a single charge to unleash a wave of terror. All creatures within a 30-foot radius of the wielder must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be filled with dread, becoming frightened of the wielder for one minute. While in this state, the creature will attempt to flee from the wielder as far as possible, and will not willingly move within 30 feet of them. Additionally, they cannot take reactions and can only use the Dash action or attempt to escape from any effect that prevents them from moving. At the end of each of their turns, the creature may attempt the saving throw again, ending the effect on a success.

The Mace of Terror regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
