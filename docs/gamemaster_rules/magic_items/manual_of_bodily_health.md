# Manual of Bodily Health
_Wondrous item, very rare_

This tome contains advice on health and nutrition, and its words are imbued with magic. If one spends 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and following its guidelines, their Constitution score increases by 2, as does their maximum for that score. The manual then loses its enchantment, but regains it after a century.
