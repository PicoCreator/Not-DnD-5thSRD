# Tome of Muscular Exercise
_Wondrous item, very rare_

This tome contains instructions for physical exertion, and its words are imbued with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and following its guidelines, your Strength score will increase by 2, as will your maximum for that score. The tome then loses its enchantment, but will regain it after a century.
