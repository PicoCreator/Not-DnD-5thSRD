# Tome of Golems
_Wondrous item, very rare_

This book contains the knowledge and incantations necessary to craft a certain type of golem. The GM can choose the type or determine it randomly. To decipher and use the tome, one must be a spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. Any creature that cannot use a **Tome of Golems** and attempts to read it will suffer 6d6 psychic damage.

| d20   | Golem | Time     | Cost       |
|-------|-------|----------|------------|
| 1-5   | Clay  | 30 days  | 65,000 gp  |
| 6-17  | Flesh | 60 days  | 50,000 gp  |
| 18    | Iron  | 120 days | 100,000 gp |
| 19-20 | Stone | 90 days  | 80,000 gp  |

To create a golem, one must spend the time listed on the table, working without interruption with the tome in hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. Additionally, the specified cost must be paid to purchase the necessary supplies.

Once the golem is crafted, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem is brought to life when the ashes of the tome are sprinkled on it. It is under the control of the creator, and it understands and obeys spoken commands.
