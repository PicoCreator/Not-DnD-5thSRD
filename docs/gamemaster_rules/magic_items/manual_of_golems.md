# Tome of Golems 
_Wondrous item, very rare_ 

This ancient tome contains the secrets and incantations necessary to bring forth a particular type of golem. The GM shall choose the type or determine it randomly. To decipher and use the tome, one must be a spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. Any creature that attempts to read the tome without the ability to use it shall suffer 6d6 psychic damage. 

| d20   | Golem | Time     | Cost       |
|-------|-------|----------|------------|
| 1-5   | Clay  | A month  | 65,000 gp  |
| 6-17  | Flesh | Two months| 50,000 gp  |
| 18    | Iron  | Four months| 100,000 gp |
| 19-20 | Stone | Three months  | 80,000 gp  |

To bring forth a golem, one must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the tome at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. One must also pay the specified cost to purchase the necessary supplies.

Once the golem is brought forth, the tome is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem is brought to life when the ashes of the tome are sprinkled upon it. It is under the control of the caster, and it understands and obeys their spoken commands.
