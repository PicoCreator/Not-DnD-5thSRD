# Tome of Swiftness of Action
_Wondrous item, very rare_

This tome contains exercises of coordination and balance, and its words are imbued with magic. If one spends 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, their Dexterity score increases by 2, as does their maximum for that score. The tome then loses its enchantment, but regains it in a century.
