# Splendid Pigments 
_Astonishing item, exceedingly rare_ 

Typically found in 1d4 pots within a luxurious wooden box, accompanied by a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments permit one to craft three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. As one focuses on the image of the desired object, the paint flows from the brush to form the object.

Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, allowing one to create inanimate objects or terrain features--such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons-- that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.

When the painting is finished, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a genuine, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever lies beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects one creates.

Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If one paints an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object appears authentic, but upon closer inspection it is revealed to be made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.

If one paints a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as the painting is complete, causing no harm to anything.
