# Splendid Pigments
_Astonishing item, very rare_

These pigments are usually found in 1d4 pots, contained within a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total). By painting two-dimensional images, these pigments can create three-dimensional objects. Each pot of paint is enough to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, allowing you to create inanimate objects or terrain features - such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons - that are up to 10,000 cubic feet in size. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.

When the painting is finished, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.

Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.

If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.
