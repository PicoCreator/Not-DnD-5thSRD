# The Looking Glass of Life-Trapping
_Wondrous item, very rare_

This four-foot tall looking glass is a marvel to behold. Its surface is a shimmering silver, and when viewed from an angle, faint images of creatures can be seen. The glass weighs fifty pounds, and is protected by an AC of 11 and 10 hit points. It is vulnerable to bludgeoning damage, and will shatter and be destroyed if reduced to 0 hit points.

When the looking glass is hung on a vertical surface and one is within five feet of it, an action can be used to speak its command word and activate it. It will remain activated until the command word is spoken again.

Any creature that views its reflection in the activated looking glass while within thirty feet of it must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the looking glass' twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the looking glass' nature, and constructs automatically succeed on the saving throw.

An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to ten feet. Creatures trapped in the looking glass' cells do not age, and do not need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.

If the looking glass traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the looking glass will randomly free one trapped creature to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the looking glass but facing away from it. If the looking glass is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.

While within five feet of the looking glass, an action can be used to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the looking glass' surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.

In a similar way, an action can be used to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the looking glass. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the looking glass and facing away from it.
