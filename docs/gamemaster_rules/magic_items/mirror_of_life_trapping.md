# Mirror of Life Capturing
_Wondrous item, very rare_

This 4-foot-tall mirror, weighing 50 pounds, has AC 11, 10 hit points, and is vulnerable to bludgeoning damage. When viewed indirectly, faint images of creatures can be seen on its surface. If the mirror is hung on a vertical surface and someone is within 5 feet of it, an action can be used to speak its command word and activate it. The mirror will remain activated until the command word is spoken again.

Any creature other than the one who activated it, that sees its reflection in the mirror while within 30 feet of it, must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror's nature, and constructs automatically succeed on the saving throw.

An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells do not age, and do not need to eat, drink, or sleep. To escape, a creature must use magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.

If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror will randomly free one trapped creature to accommodate the new prisoner. The freed creature will appear in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains will be freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.

While within 5 feet of the mirror, an action can be used to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell will appear as an image on the mirror's surface. The creature and the one who activated the mirror can then communicate normally.

In a similar way, an action can be used to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature will appear, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.
