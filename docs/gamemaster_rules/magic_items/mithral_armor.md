# Mithral Plate
_Armour (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon_

Mithral is a light and supple metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn beneath regular clothing. If the armour usually imposes a disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armour does not.
