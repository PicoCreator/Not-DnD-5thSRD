# Necklace of Blazing Fire
_Wondrous item, rare_

This necklace is adorned with 1d6 + 3 beads of a fiery hue. By taking an action, one of these beads can be detached and thrown up to 60 feet away. Upon reaching its destination, the bead will detonate with the force of a 3rd-level **_fireball_** spell (save DC 15).

The necklace can be thrown as one action, with each bead beyond the first increasing the level of the **_fireball_** by one.
