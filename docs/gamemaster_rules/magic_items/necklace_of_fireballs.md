# Necklace of Fireballs
_Wondrous item, rare_

This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and hurl it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level **_fireball_** spell (save DC 15).

You can throw multiple beads, or even the entire necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the **_fireball_** by 1 for each bead beyond the first.
