# Necklace of Prayer Beads
_A wondrous item of rare power, requiring attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin_

This necklace is adorned with 1d4 + 2 magical beads, crafted from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It is also strung with many nonmagical beads of various stones, such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magical bead is removed from the necklace, it will lose its power.

Six types of magical beads exist, and the GM can decide the type of each bead on the necklace or determine it randomly. To use one, the necklace must be worn. Each bead contains a spell that can be cast as a bonus action (using the spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magical bead's spell is cast, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
