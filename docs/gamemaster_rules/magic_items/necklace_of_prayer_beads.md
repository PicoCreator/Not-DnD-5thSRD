# Necklace of Prayer Beads
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)_

This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magical beads crafted from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magical bead is removed from the necklace, it loses its power.

Six types of magical beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magical bead's spell is cast, that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.
