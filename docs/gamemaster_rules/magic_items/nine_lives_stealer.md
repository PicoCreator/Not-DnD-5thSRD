# Soul Reaver
_Weapon (any sword), exceedingly rare (requires attunement)_

You are granted a +2 boon to your attack and damage rolls when wielding this enchanted weapon.

The sword holds 1d8 + 1 charges. If you land a critical strike against a creature with fewer than 100 hit points, they must pass a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be instantly slain as the sword siphons away their life force (constructs and undead are immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges left, it loses this property.
