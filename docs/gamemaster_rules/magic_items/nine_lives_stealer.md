# Soul Reaver
_Blade (any sword), exceedingly rare (requires attunement)_

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon.

The blade has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you land a critical strike against a creature with fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be instantly slain as the blade steals its life force (constructs and undead are immune). The blade loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the blade has no charges left, it loses this property.
