# Oathbow
_Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)_

When you draw back the string of this bow, it speaks in a tongue of old, "Let my enemies know swift defeat." When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a command phrase, say, "Let those who have wronged me know swift death." The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until the sun rises seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.

When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have the upper hand on the roll. In addition, your target gains no protection from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage.

While your sworn enemy lives, you have a disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.
