# Elixir of Ethereality
_Elixir, rare_

Tiny droplets of this cloudy gray elixir form on the outside of its container and quickly dissipate. The elixir can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the elixir takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the **_ethereality_** spell for 1 hour.
