# Elixir of Transcendence
_Potion, rare_

Tiny droplets of this mysterious gray elixir form on the outside of its container and quickly dissipate. The elixir can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (an additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the elixir takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the power of the **_transcendence_** spell for 1 hour.
