# Elixir of Slipperiness 
_Potion, uncommon_ 

This viscous black elixir is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The elixir can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the elixir takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a **_freedom of movement_** spell for 8 hours.

Alternatively, the elixir can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, replicating the effect of the **_grease_** spell in that area for 8 hours.
