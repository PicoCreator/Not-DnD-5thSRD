# Orb of Dragonkind 
_Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)_ 

In ages past, when the world was threatened by the wickedness of dragons, powerful wizards of old gathered together and worked their greatest magic, forging five **Orbs of Dragonkind** (or **Dragon Orbs**) to aid them in their struggle. One of these orbs was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to hasten the war to a victorious conclusion. The wizards used the orbs to draw dragons to them, and then destroyed the dragons with their powerful magics.

As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were either destroyed or lost to legend, and only three are thought to remain. Over the centuries, their magic has been warped and twisted, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also grant some measure of control over dragons.

Each orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.

When attuned to an orb, one can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. A DC 15 Charisma check must then be made. On a successful check, the user will control the orb for as long as they remain attuned to it. On a failed check, the user will become charmed by the orb for as long as they remain attuned to it.

While charmed by the orb, the user cannot voluntarily end their attunement to it, and the orb will cast **_suggestion_** on them at will (save DC 18), urging them to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides. 

### Random Properties. 
An **Orb of Dragonkind** has the following random properties:
* 2 minor beneficial properties
* 1 minor detrimental property
* 1 major detrimental property 

### Spells. 
The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If the user controls the orb, they can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: **_cure wounds_** (5th-level version, 3 charges), **_daylight_** (1 charge), **_death ward_** (2 charges), or **_scrying_** (3 charges).

The user can also use an action to cast the **_detect magic_** spell from the orb without using any charges.

**Call Dragons.** While the user controls the orb, they can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward the user for compelling them against their will. Once this property has been used, it cannot be used again for 1 hour.

**Destroying an Orb.** An **Orb of Dragonkind** appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A **_disintegrate_** spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.
