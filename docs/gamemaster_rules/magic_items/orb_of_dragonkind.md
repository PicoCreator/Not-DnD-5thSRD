Name: Orb of Dragonkind
Type: Artifact

# Orb of Dragonkind 
_Wondrous Item, Artifact (requires attunement)_ 

In ages past, elves and humans fought a fierce battle against wicked dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards gathered and used their mightiest magic to forge five **Orbs of Dragonkind** (or **Dragon Orbs**) to aid them in their struggle. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to hasten the war to a victorious conclusion. The wizards used the orbs to draw dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.

As the wizard towers fell in later times, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are believed to remain. Over the centuries, their magic has been warped and twisted, so although their primary purpose of summoning dragons still functions, they also grant some measure of control over dragons.

Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in strength of will might find themselves enslaved to an orb.

An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it expands to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.

While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to gaze into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.

While you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts **_suggestion_** on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the destruction of a certain people, freedom from the orb, to spread misery in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides. 

### Random Properties. 
An **Orb of Dragonkind** has the following random properties:
* 2 minor beneficial properties
* 1 minor detrimental property
* 1 major detrimental property 

### Spells. 
The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: **_cure wounds_** (5th-level version, 3 charges), **_daylight_** (1 charge), **_death ward_** (2 charges), or **_scrying_** (3 charges).

You can also use an action to cast the **_detect magic_** spell from the orb without using any charges.

**Call Dragons.** While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.

**Destroying an Orb.** An **Orb of Dragonkind** appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A **_disintegrate_** spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.
