# Orb of Renewal
_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)_

Whilst this orb is in your possession, you may use an action to utter its command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you have used the orb, it cannot be used again until the next morn.
