# Elixir of Ardor
_Potion, uncommon_

Upon imbibing this elixir, the imbiber will find themselves bewitched by the next creature they lay eyes upon within the next ten minutes. This enchantment will last for one hour, and if the creature is of a species and gender that the imbiber is naturally drawn to, they will regard them as their one true love. This potion's rosy, effervescent liquid contains a single bubble, shaped like a heart, that is easily overlooked.
