# Philter of Ardour
_Elixir, uncommon_

Once this elixir is imbibed, the imbiber will be bewitched by the next creature they lay eyes upon within the next 10 minutes. This enchantment will last for an hour, and if the creature is of a species and gender that the imbiber is normally attracted to, they will regard them as their one true love. This elixir's rosy, effervescent liquid contains one bubble shaped like a heart, which is easily overlooked.
