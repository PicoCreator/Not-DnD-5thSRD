# The Charming Pipes
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

To use these pipes, one must be proficient in the art of playing wind instruments. They possess three charges, and with an action, one can play them and expend a single charge to create a captivating and bewitching melody. All creatures within a 30 foot radius of the player that hear the music must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become enchanted by the player for one minute. If the player so desires, all creatures in the area that are not hostile to them automatically pass the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can attempt it again at the end of each of its turns, and if successful, the effect will be broken. A creature that passes the saving throw will be immune to the effects of the pipes for 24 hours. The pipes will regain 1d3 expended charges at the break of dawn.
