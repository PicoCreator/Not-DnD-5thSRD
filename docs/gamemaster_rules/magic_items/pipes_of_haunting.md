# Pipes of Haunting 
_Wondrous item, uncommon_ 

To use these pipes, one must be skilled in the playing of wind instruments. They possess three charges. An action can be used to play them and expend one charge to create a bewitching, eerie melody. All creatures within 30 feet of the player that hear the music must pass a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be filled with dread of the player for one minute. If the player desires, all creatures in the area that are not hostile to them automatically pass the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can attempt it again at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself if successful. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effects of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
