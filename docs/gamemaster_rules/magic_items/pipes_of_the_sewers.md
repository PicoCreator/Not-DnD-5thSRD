# Pipes of the Sewers
_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

To use these pipes, one must be proficient in playing wind instruments. When attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats will not attack unless provoked or threatened.

The pipes have 3 charges. By playing the pipes as an action, one can expend 1 to 3 charges with a bonus action, calling forth a swarm of rats with each charge, provided there are enough rats within half a mile of the player (as determined by the GM). If there are not enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. The swarms will move towards the music by the shortest available route, but are not under the player's control. The pipes will regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

Whenever a swarm of rats that is not under another creature's control comes within 30 feet of the player while they are playing the pipes, they can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm's Wisdom check. If the player loses the contest, the swarm will behave as it normally would and cannot be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. If the player wins the contest, the swarm will be swayed by the pipes' music and become friendly to the player and their companions as long as the player continues to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm will obey the player's commands. If the player does not issue any commands to a friendly swarm, it will defend itself but take no other actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and cannot hear the pipes' music, the player's control over the swarm ends, and the swarm will behave as it normally would and cannot be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.
