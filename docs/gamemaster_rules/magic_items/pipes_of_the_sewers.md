Name: The Pipes of the Sewers
Type: Wondrous Item, Uncommon (requires attunement)

The Pipes of the Sewers are a wondrous item of uncommon rarity, requiring attunement to be used. Those proficient with wind instruments may use the pipes to their advantage. While attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats will not attack unless provoked or threatened.

The pipes have three charges, which can be used to call forth swarms of rats within a half-mile radius. To do so, one must play the pipes as an action, and expend one to three charges as a bonus action. If there are not enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. The swarms will move towards the music by the shortest available route, but will not be under the user's control. The pipes will regain one to three expended charges daily at dawn.

Whenever a swarm of rats that is not under another creature's control comes within thirty feet of the user while they are playing the pipes, they may make a Charisma check contested by the swarm's Wisdom check. If the user loses the contest, the swarm will behave as it normally would and cannot be swayed by the pipes' music for the next twenty-four hours. If the user wins the contest, the swarm will be swayed by the pipes' music and become friendly to the user and their companions for as long as the user continues to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm will obey the user's commands. If no commands are issued, the swarm will defend itself but take no other actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and cannot hear the pipes' music, the user's control over the swarm ends, and the swarm will behave as it normally would and cannot be swayed by the pipes' music for the next twenty-four hours.
