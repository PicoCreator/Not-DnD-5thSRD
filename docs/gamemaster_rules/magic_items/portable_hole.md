# Mystic Portal
_Wondrous item, rare_

This fine black cloth, as soft as the finest silk, is folded up to the size of a handkerchief. When unfolded, it reveals a circular sheet of fabric six feet in diameter.

By using an action, one can unfold the Mystic Portal and place it on or against a solid surface. Upon doing so, an extradimensional hole is created, ten feet deep. This cylindrical space exists on a different plane, and thus cannot be used to create open passages. Any creature within the open Mystic Portal can exit by climbing out.

Using an action, one can close the Mystic Portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth will close the hole, trapping any creatures or objects within the extradimensional space. Despite the contents, the hole weighs next to nothing.

If the hole is folded up, a creature within the extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature will be forced out and appear within five feet of the Mystic Portal or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed Mystic Portal can survive for up to ten minutes, after which time it will begin to suffocate.

Placing a Mystic Portal inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Handy Haversack, or similar item will instantly destroy both items and open a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate will originate from the location of the item placed inside the other. Any creature within ten feet of the gate will be sucked through and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate will then close, and cannot be reopened.
