# Portable Hole
_Wondrous item, rare_

This fine black cloth, as soft as silk, is folded up to the size of a handkerchief. When unfolded, it becomes a circular sheet of six feet in diameter.

By using an action, one can unfold the **Portable Hole** and place it on or against a solid surface. This will create an extradimensional hole of ten feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole is on a different plane, so it cannot be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open **Portable Hole** can exit by climbing out.

An action can be used to close the **Portable Hole** by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth will close the hole, and any creatures or objects within will remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what is inside, the hole will weigh next to nothing.

If the hole is folded up, a creature within the extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature will be forced out and appear within five feet of the **Portable Hole** or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed **Portable Hole** can survive for up to ten minutes, after which time it will begin to suffocate.

Placing a **Portable Hole** inside an extradimensional space created by a **Bag of Holding**, **Handy Haversack**, or similar item will instantly destroy both items and open a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate will originate from where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within ten feet of the gate will be sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate will then close and cannot be reopened.
