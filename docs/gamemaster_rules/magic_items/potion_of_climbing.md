# Elixir of Ascending
_Elixir, Uncommon_

When you imbibe this elixir, you are granted a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for one hour. During this time, you are granted an advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks you make to climb. The elixir is divided into three distinct layers of brown, silver, and gray, resembling bands of stone. No matter how vigorously you shake the bottle, the colors remain distinct.
