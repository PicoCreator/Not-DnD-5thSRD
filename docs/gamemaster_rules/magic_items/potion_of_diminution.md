# Elixir of Diminution
_Elixir, Rare_

When you imbibe this elixir, you shall be granted the power of the **_Enlargen/Diminish_** spell for 1d4 hours, with no need for concentration. The red hue of the elixir shall swirl and contract, forming a tiny bead, before expanding to fill the clear liquid around it. No matter how much the bottle is shaken, this process shall remain unaltered.
