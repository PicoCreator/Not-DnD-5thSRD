# Elixir of Diminution
_Elixir, rare_

When you imbibe this elixir, you gain the "reduce" effect of the **_enlarge/reduce_** spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the elixir's liquid continuously contracts to a small bead and then expands to colour the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle does not interrupt this process.
