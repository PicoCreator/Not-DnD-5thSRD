# Elixir of Levitation
_Elixir, very rare_

When you imbibe this elixir, you gain the ability to fly at your walking speed for one hour. You can hover in the air, but if the elixir's effects wear off while you are still aloft, you will fall unless you have some other means of staying afloat. This elixir's liquid is clear and has cloudy white impurities that drift within it.
