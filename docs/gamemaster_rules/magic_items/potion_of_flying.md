# Elixir of Levitation
_Elixir, exceedingly rare_

Upon imbibing this elixir, you shall be granted the power of flight for a duration of one hour. You may soar through the skies with the same speed as your walking speed, and even hover in the air. When the elixir's effects have worn off, you shall fall to the ground unless you have some other means of staying aloft. This elixir's liquid is a clear hue, and is filled with cloudy white impurities that drift within it.
