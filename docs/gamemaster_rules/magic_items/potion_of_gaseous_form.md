# Elixir of Ethereal Form
_Elixir, Rare_

When you imbibe this elixir, you are granted the power of the **_ethereal form_** spell for one hour, or until you choose to end the effect with a bonus action. The container of this elixir appears to be filled with a mist that swirls and flows like a river.
