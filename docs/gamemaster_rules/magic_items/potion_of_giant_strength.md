# Elixir of Giant Might
_Elixir, rarity varies_

When you imbibe this elixir, your Strength shall be transformed for one hour. The type of giant shall determine the score (see the table below). The elixir shall have no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.

This elixir's limpid liquid contains a sliver of nail from a giant of the appropriate type. The **elixir of frost giant might** and the **elixir of stone giant might** have the same effect.
