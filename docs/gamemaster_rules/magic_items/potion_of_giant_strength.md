# Elixir of Giant Might
_Elixir, rarity varies_

When you drink this elixir, your Strength score is altered for one hour. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The elixir has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.

This elixir's clear liquid contains a sliver of a giant's nail of the appropriate type. The **elixir of frost giant might** and the **elixir of stone giant might** have the same effect.
