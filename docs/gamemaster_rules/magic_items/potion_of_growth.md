# Elixir of Expansion
_Elixir, Uncommon_

When you imbibe this elixir, you are granted the grandiose power of the **_Enlargement/Reduction_** spell for a period of 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The crimson hue of the elixir's liquid swirls and ebbs, ever-changing in size and intensity. No matter how vigorously the bottle is shaken, the liquid remains in constant flux.
