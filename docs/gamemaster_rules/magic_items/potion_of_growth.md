# Elixir of Expansion
_Elixir, Uncommon_

When you imbibe this elixir, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the **_Enlarge/Reduce_** spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the elixir's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to colour the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle does not disrupt this process.
