# Elixir of Invisibility
_Elixir, very rare_

This elixir's vessel appears to be empty, yet it feels as though it contains liquid. When you consume it, you become invisible for one hour. Anything you don, or carry, is also invisible with you. The effect ends prematurely if you cast a spell or attack.
