# Elixir of Invisibility
_Elixir, exceedingly rare_

This elixir's vessel appears to be empty, yet it feels as though it contains a liquid. Upon imbibing it, you shall become invisible for a period of one hour. Anything you don or carry shall be rendered invisible with you. The effect shall end prematurely should you choose to attack or cast a spell.
