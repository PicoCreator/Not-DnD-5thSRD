# Elixir of Maleficence
_Potion, uncommon_

This draught appears, smells, and tastes like a **potion of restoration** or other beneficial potion. However, it is in truth a concoction of malevolent magic. An **_identify_** spell will reveal its true nature.

Should you consume it, you will suffer 3d6 points of poison damage, and must pass a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you will take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you may attempt the saving throw again. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns will decrease by 1d6. The poison will cease when the damage decreases to 0.
