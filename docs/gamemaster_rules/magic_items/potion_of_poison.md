# Elixir of Venom
_Elixir, Uncommon_

This draught appears, smells, and tastes like a **potion of healing** or other beneficial elixir. However, it is actually a venom masked by illusion magic. An **_identify_** spell reveals its true nature.

If you drink it, you take 3d6 venom damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 venom damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the venom damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.
