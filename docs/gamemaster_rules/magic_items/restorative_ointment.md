# Elixir of Restoration
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This glass jar, three inches in diameter, contains a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. Within the jar lies 1d4 + 1 doses of the elixir, and the jar and its contents weigh a mere half pound.

By taking a dose of the elixir as an action, the imbiber is restored with vigor and vitality. The recipient regains 2d8 + 2 hit points, is freed from any poison, and is cured of any disease.
