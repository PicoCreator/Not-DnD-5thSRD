# Summoning of the Djinn
_Legendary (requires attunement)_

When wearing this ring, you may speak its command word as an action to summon a particular djinn from the Plane of Air. The djinn appears in an unoccupied space of your choosing, within 120 feet of you. It will remain as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), for a maximum of one hour, or until it reaches 0 hit points. Then, it will return to its home plane.

The djinn is friendly to you and your companions while summoned. It will obey any commands you give it, no matter the language. If you fail to command it, the djinn will defend itself against attackers, but take no other actions.

Once the djinn departs, it cannot be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring will become nonmagical if the djinn dies.
