name: The Band of the Djinni
type: ring

# The Band of the Djinni Summoning 
_Ring, legendary (requires attunement)_ 

Whilst wearing this enchanted band, you may speak its command word as an action to summon a particular djinni from the Elemental Plane of Air. The djinni appears in an unoccupied space of your choosing within 120 feet of you. It will remain as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), for a maximum of one hour, or until it is reduced to 0 hit points. Upon such an event, it will return to its home plane.

The djinni summoned will be friendly to you and your companions. It will obey any commands you give it, no matter the language you use. If you fail to command it, the djinni will defend itself against attackers, but take no other actions.

Once the djinni departs, it cannot be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring will become nonmagical if the djinni perishes.
