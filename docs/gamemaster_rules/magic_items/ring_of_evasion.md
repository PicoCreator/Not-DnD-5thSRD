# The Band of Elusion
_Ring, rare (requires attunement)_

This enchanted band has 3 charges, and it is restored with 1d3 expended charges each day at the break of dawn. When you are faced with a Dexterity saving throw while wearing it, you may use your reaction to expend one of its charges to succeed on that saving throw instead.
