type: ring

# The Band of Concealment
_Ring, legendary (requires attunement)_

When donning this enchanted band, you may vanish from sight as an action. All that you bear or carry shall be cloaked in the same veil of invisibility. You shall remain unseen until the ring is removed, until you make an attack or cast a spell, or until you use a bonus action to become visible once more.
