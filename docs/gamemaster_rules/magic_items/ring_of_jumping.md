# The Grand Circle of Leaping
_Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)_

When wearing this grand circle, you can cast the spell of leaping from it as a bonus action at will, but you can only target yourself when doing so. With a single bound, you can soar through the air with ease, allowing you to traverse the land with remarkable speed.
