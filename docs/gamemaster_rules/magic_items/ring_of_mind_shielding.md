# Ring of Mental Shielding
_Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)_

Whilst wearing this ring, you are immune to any magical means of another creature reading your thoughts, discerning whether you are telling the truth, knowing your alignment, or knowing your creature type. You may only be communicated with telepathically if you allow it.

You may use an action to make the ring invisible until you use another action to make it visible again, until you remove the ring, or until you die.

Should you pass away whilst wearing the ring, your soul shall enter it, unless it already contains a soul. You may remain in the ring or depart for the afterlife. As long as your soul is in the ring, you may telepathically communicate with any creature wearing it. The wearer cannot prevent this telepathic communication.
