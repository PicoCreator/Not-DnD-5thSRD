# The Mind-Shield Ring
_Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)_

Whilst wearing this ring, you are safeguarded from any magical forces that would seek to pry into your thoughts, discern whether you are being truthful, discern your alignment, or discern your creature type. Creatures may only communicate with you telepathically if you grant them permission.

You may use an action to render the ring invisible, until you use another action to make it visible again, until you remove the ring, or until you pass away.

Should you perish whilst wearing the ring, your soul shall enter it, unless it already contains a soul. You may remain within the ring or depart for the afterlife. As long as your soul is within the ring, you may communicate telepathically with any creature wearing it. The wearer of the ring cannot prevent this telepathic communication.
