# The Celestial Circle 
_A rare and wondrous ring, requiring attunement outdoors at night_ 

When wearing this ring in the dimmest of light or in the depths of darkness, you can cast **_dancing lights_** and **_light_** from the ring at will. Utilizing either of these spells requires an action.

The ring holds 6 charges, each of which can be used to activate the following properties. The ring regains 1d6 expended charges daily at the break of dawn.

**Faerie Fire.** You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast **_faerie fire_** from the ring.

**Ball Lightning.** You can expend 2 charges as an action to create one to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you create, the less powerful each sphere is individually.

Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The spheres remain as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere emits a dim light in a 30-foot radius.

As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created. 

| Spheres | Lightning Damage |
|---------|------------------|
| 4       | 2d4              |
| 3       | 2d6              |
| 2       | 5d4              |
| 1       | 4d12             |

**Shooting Stars.** You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For every charge you expend, you launch a brilliant mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
