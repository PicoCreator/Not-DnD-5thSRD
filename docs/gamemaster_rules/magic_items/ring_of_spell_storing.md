# The Ring of Spellbinding
_Ring, rare (requires attunement)_

This enchanted ring is capable of storing powerful spells, holding them until the attuned wearer is ready to unleash them. It can contain up to five levels worth of spells at any given time. When found, it is imbued with 1d6 - 1 levels of spells, chosen by the GM.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the ring by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring is unable to contain the spell, it is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

When wearing this ring, the wearer can cast any spell stored within it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if the wearer had cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.
