# Ring of Spell Turning
_Ring, Legendary (requires attunement)_

Whilst wearing this ring, you shall have advantage on saving throws against any spell that targets only you (not in an area of effect). Furthermore, if you roll a 20 for the save and the spell is of 7th level or lower, the spell shall have no effect on you and instead target the caster, using the slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster.
