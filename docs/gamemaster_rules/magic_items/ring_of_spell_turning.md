# The Ring of Mystic Deflection
_Ring, legendary (requires attunement)_

Whilst wearing this enchanted ring, you shall be granted an advantage on any saving throws against any spell that is cast upon you alone (not in an area of effect). Furthermore, should you roll a 20 on the saving throw and the spell is of 7th level or lower, the spell shall have no effect on you and instead be cast upon the caster, using the same slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster.
