# The Circle of the Ram 
_Ring, rare (requires attunement)_ 

This ring is imbued with a powerful enchantment, granting it three charges that are replenished each day at the break of dawn. When worn, the bearer may expend one to three of its charges as an action to unleash a spectral ram's head, which will attack a single creature within sixty feet. The attack roll is made with a +7 bonus, and if successful, the target will take 2d10 force damage and be pushed five feet away from the wielder for each charge spent.

Alternatively, the ring may be used to attempt to break an object within sixty feet that is not being worn or carried. By expending one to three of its charges as an action, the ring will make a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each charge spent.
