# Ring of X-ray Vision
_Ring, rare (requires attunement)_

When wearing this ring, you may use an action to utter its command word. For one minute, you can see through and into solid matter in a radius of 30 feet. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and do not impede light from passing through them. This vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances and a thin sheet of lead will block the vision.

Whenever you use the ring again before taking a long rest, you must pass a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion.
