# Ring of X-ray Vision 
_Ring, rare (requires attunement)_ 

When donning this ring, the wearer may utter its command word as an action. For one minute, the wearer is granted the power of X-ray vision, allowing them to see through solid objects within a radius of 30 feet. This vision can penetrate up to 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances, as well as a thin sheet of lead, will block the vision.

Should the wearer use the ring again before taking a long rest, they must pass a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion.
