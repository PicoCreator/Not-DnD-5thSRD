# Gaze of the Ancients
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

This robe is adorned with ancient symbols, each one a window to the world beyond. While wearing the robe, you gain the following benefits:

* The robe grants you a vision that transcends the physical realm, granting you advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
* You have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
* You can see invisible creatures and objects, as well as peer into the Ethereal Plane, out to a range of 120 feet.

The symbols on the robe cannot be averted, and you are never considered to be doing so while wearing this robe.

A **_light_** spell cast on the robe or a **_daylight_** spell cast within 5 feet of the robe causes you to be blinded for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for **_light_** or DC 15 for **_daylight_**), ending the blindness on a success.
