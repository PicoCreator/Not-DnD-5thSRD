# Robe of Glittering Splendour
_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

This robe is imbued with a powerful enchantment, granting it three charges. Each day at dawn, it regains 1d3 expended charges. When donned, the wearer may expend one charge to cause the garment to shimmer with a kaleidoscope of dazzling hues. This effect lasts until the end of the wearer's next turn, and illuminates a 30-foot radius with bright light and an additional 30 feet with dim light. All creatures that can see the wearer have disadvantage on attack rolls against them. Furthermore, any creature in the bright light that can see the wearer must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become stunned until the effect ends.
