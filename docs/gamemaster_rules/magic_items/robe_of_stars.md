# Robe of Stars
_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

This robe is of a dark blue or black hue, and is embroidered with small white or silver stars. Whilst wearing this robe, one is granted a +1 bonus to saving throws.

Six stars, located on the robe's upper front portion, are particularly large. By using an action, one of these stars can be removed and used to cast **_magic missile_** as a 5th-level spell. At dusk each day, 1d6 removed stars will reappear on the robe.

By using an action, the wearer of the robe can enter the Astral Plane, along with all that they are wearing and carrying. They will remain there until they use an action to return to the plane they were on. They will reappear in the last space they occupied, or if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space.
