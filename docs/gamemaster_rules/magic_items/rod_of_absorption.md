# The Rod of Abstraction 
_Rod, of a rare and wondrous nature (requires attunement)_ 

When one holds this rod, they may use their reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting them alone, and not an area of effect. The spell's effect is then nullified, and the spell's energy--not the spell itself--is stored within the rod. This energy is of the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to fifty levels of energy in its lifetime. Once the rod has reached its capacity, it can no longer absorb more. If the rod is unable to store a spell, it will have no effect on it.

When one attunes to the rod, they will know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed in its lifetime, and how many levels of spell energy it currently holds.

If one is a spellcaster and holds the rod, they may convert the stored energy into spell slots to cast spells they have prepared or know. Spell slots created must be of a level equal to or lower than the caster's own spell slots, up to a maximum of fifth level. The stored levels are used in place of the caster's slots, but the spell is cast as normal. For example, three levels stored in the rod may be used as a third-level spell slot.

A newly found rod will have one to ten levels of spell energy stored in it. If a rod can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining, it will become nonmagical.
