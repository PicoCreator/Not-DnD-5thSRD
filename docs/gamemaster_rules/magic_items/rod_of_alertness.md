# The Rod of Vigilance
_Rod, very rare (requires attunement)_

This rod is fashioned with a flanged head and possesses the following properties.

**Vigilance.** When wielding the rod, you are granted an advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and rolls for initiative.

**Spells.** When wielding the rod, you may use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: **_detect evil and good_**, **_detect magic_**, **_detect poison and disease_**, or **_see invisibility_**.

**Protective Aura.** As an action, you may plant the haft end of the rod into the ground, whereupon the rod's head will emit a bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in this bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you will gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and can sense the location of any invisible hostile creature that is also in the bright light.

The rod's head will cease to glow and the effect will end after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to remove the rod from the ground. This property cannot be used again until the next dawn.
