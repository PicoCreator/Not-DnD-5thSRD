# The Grand Sceptre of Sovereignty
_Sceptre, legendary (requires attunement)_

This grand sceptre is adorned with a flanged head, and it functions as a magical mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The sceptre has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.

**Six Buttons.** You can press one of the sceptre's six buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the sceptre to revert to its normal form.

If you press **button 1**, the sceptre becomes a **flaming blade**, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the sceptre's flanged head.

If you press **button 2**, the sceptre's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the sceptre into a magical battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

If you press **button 3**, the sceptre's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the sceptre's tip, and the sceptre's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the sceptre into a magical spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

If you press **button 4**, the sceptre transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the sceptre to revert to its normal form.

If you press **button 5**, the sceptre transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.

If you press **button 6**, the sceptre assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the sceptre is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The sceptre also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.

**Drain Life.** When you strike a creature with a melee attack using the sceptre, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

**Paralyze.** When you strike a creature with a melee attack using the sceptre, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

**Terrify.** While holding the sceptre, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
