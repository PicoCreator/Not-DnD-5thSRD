# Sceptre of Sovereignty
_Sceptre, rare (requires attunement)_

By using an action, you may present the sceptre and demand obedience from any creature you can see within 120 feet of you. Each target must pass a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 8 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature will regard you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, the target will no longer be charmed. The sceptre cannot be used again until the next dawn.
