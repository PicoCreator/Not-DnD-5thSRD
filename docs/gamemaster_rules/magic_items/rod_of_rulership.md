# Scepter of Sovereignty
_Scepter, rare (requires attunement)_

By employing an action, you may present the scepter and demand obedience from any creature you can see within 120 feet of you. Each target must pass a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be enchanted by you for 8 hours. While enchanted in this manner, the creature will regard you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, the target will no longer be enchanted. The scepter cannot be used again until the following dawn.
