# Rod of Sanctuary
_Rod, very rare_

By grasping this rod, you can use an action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a paradise that exists in an extraplanar space. You decide the form of the paradise. It could be a tranquil garden, a pleasant glade, a jovial tavern, a grand palace, a tropical island, a fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough food and water to sustain its visitors. Anything that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can only exist there. For example, a flower taken from the garden in the paradise will vanish if it is brought outside the extraplanar space.

For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if they had used 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures do not age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).

When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or the nearest unoccupied space. The rod cannot be used again until ten days have passed.
