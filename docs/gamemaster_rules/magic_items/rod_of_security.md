# The Rod of Security
_A most rare and wondrous item_

When this rod is held aloft, its wielder may use an action to activate it. In an instant, the rod will transport up to 199 willing creatures, visible to the wielder, to a paradise of their own design. This paradise may take any form imaginable, be it a tranquil garden, a cheery tavern, a tropical island, or a fantastic carnival. All necessary sustenance is provided, and time passes normally, though no creature ages while in the paradise.

For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor is restored as if they had spent a single Hit Die. The paradise may be enjoyed for up to 200 days, divided by the number of creatures present (rounded down).

When the allotted time has passed, or the wielder uses an action to end it, all visitors are returned to the location they occupied when the rod was activated, or the nearest unoccupied space. The rod may not be used again for ten days.
