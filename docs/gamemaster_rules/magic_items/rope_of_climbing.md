# Rope of Climbing
_Wondrous Item, Uncommon_

This length of silk rope is 60 feet long and weighs 3 pounds, able to hold up to 3,000 pounds. If one holds one end of the rope and speaks the command word, the rope will animate. As a bonus action, one can command the other end to move towards a chosen destination. The rope will move 10 feet on the turn it is commanded and 10 feet on each turn until it reaches its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until it is told to stop. It can also be commanded to fasten itself securely to an object, unfasten itself, knot or unknot itself, or coil itself for carrying.

If the rope is commanded to knot, large knots will appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. When knotted, the rope will shorten to a 50-foot length and grant advantage on checks made to climb it.

The rope has an AC of 20 and 20 hit points. It will regain 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it will be destroyed.
