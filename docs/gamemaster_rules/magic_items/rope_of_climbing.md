# Rope of Ascension
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This length of silken rope, measuring sixty feet in length and weighing three pounds, is capable of bearing up to three thousand pounds. By speaking the command word and grasping one end of the rope, the rope will animate. As a bonus action, the wielder may command the other end to move towards a destination of their choosing. On each of the wielder's turns, the rope will move ten feet towards its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until the wielder commands it to stop. The wielder may also command the rope to fasten itself securely to an object, unfasten itself, knot or unknot itself, or coil itself for carrying.

If the rope is commanded to knot, large knots will appear at one foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope will shorten to a length of fifty feet and grant advantage on checks made to climb it.

The rope has an AC of twenty and twenty hit points. It will regain one hit point every five minutes, so long as it has at least one hit point. If the rope drops to zero hit points, it is destroyed.
