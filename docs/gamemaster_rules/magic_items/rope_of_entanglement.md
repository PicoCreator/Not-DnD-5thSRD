# Cord of Entanglement
_Wondrous item, rare_

This cord is thirty feet in length and weighs three pounds. If one holds one end of the cord and speaks its command word, the other end will dart forth with remarkable speed to ensnare a creature within twenty feet of the holder. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained.
