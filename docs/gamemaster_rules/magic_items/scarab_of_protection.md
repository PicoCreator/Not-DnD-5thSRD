# Scarab of Protection 
_Enchanting trinket, legendary (requires attunement)_ 

If you hold this beetle-shaped medallion in your hand for a single round, a magical inscription will appear on its surface. It will grant you two boons while it is in your possession:

* You will be granted an advantage on any saving throws against spells. 
* The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an undead creature, you may use your reaction to expend one charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. When the last charge is expended, the scarab will crumble into dust and be destroyed.
