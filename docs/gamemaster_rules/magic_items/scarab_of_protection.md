# Amulet of Preservation
_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)_

When you grasp this beetle-shaped medallion in your hand for a single round, an inscription appears on its surface, revealing its magical nature. It grants two benefits while it is on your person:

* You have advantage on saving throws against spells.
* The amulet has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an undead creature, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The amulet crumbles into dust and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.
