# Aegis of Missile Attraction
_Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)_

Whilst bearing this shield, you are endowed with a resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.

**Curse.** This shield is cursed. Attuning to it will bring a curse upon you until you are targeted by the **_remove curse_** spell or similar magic. Even if you remove the shield, the curse will remain upon you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse will cause you to become the target instead.
