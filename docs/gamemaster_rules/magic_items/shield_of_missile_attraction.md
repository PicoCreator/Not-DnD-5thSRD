# Shield of Missile Deflection
_Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)_

Whilst bearing this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.

**Curse.** This shield is cursed. Attuning to it will curse you until you are targeted by the **_remove curse_** spell or similar magic. Removing the shield will not end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.
