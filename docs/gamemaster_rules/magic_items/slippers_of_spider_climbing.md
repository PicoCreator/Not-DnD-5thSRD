# Shoes of Spider Clambering
_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

Whilst wearing these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, with your hands free. You have a clambering speed equal to your walking speed. However, the shoes do not allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.
