# Slippers of Spider Scaling
_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

Whilst wearing these light shoes, you can traverse vertical surfaces and even cling to ceilings, leaving your hands free to do as you please. You can move with a speed equal to your walking speed, but the slippers will not grant you the same ability on slippery surfaces, such as those covered in ice or oil.
