# Sovereign Paste 
_Wondrous item, legendary_ 

This thick, milky-white substance can form an everlasting adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be kept in a jar or flask that has been lined within with **oil of slipperiness**. When discovered, a container holds 1d6 + 1 ounces.

One ounce of the paste can cover a 1-foot square surface. The paste takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can only be broken by the application of **universal solvent** or **oil of etherealness**, or with a **_wish_** spell.
