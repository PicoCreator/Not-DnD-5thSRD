# Mystic Tome
_Tome, varies_

A **mystic tome** contains the words of a single spell, written in a magical cipher. If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can use an action to read the tome and cast its spell without having to provide any of the spell's components. Otherwise, the tome is incomprehensible.

If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine if you cast it successfully. The DC is 10 plus the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell vanishes from the tome with no other effect.

Once the spell is cast, the words on the tome fade, and the tome itself crumbles to dust.

The level of the spell on the tome determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as shown in the Mystic Tome table.

A wizard spell on a **mystic tome** can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a **mystic tome**, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the **mystic tome** is destroyed.
