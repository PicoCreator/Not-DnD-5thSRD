# Orb of Annihilation 
_Wondrous item, legendary_ 

This two-foot-diameter black orb is a tear in the fabric of the multiverse, hovering in the air and held in place by a powerful magical field.

The orb obliterates all matter it passes through, and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception, unless they are vulnerable to the effects of an **Orb of Annihilation**, in which case they pass through unscathed. Anything else that touches the orb but is not completely engulfed and destroyed by it takes 4d10 force damage.

The orb remains stationary until someone takes control of it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled orb, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the orb levitates in a direction of your choice, up to a distance equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the orb moves 10 feet towards you. Any creature whose space the orb enters must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.

If you attempt to control an orb that is already under the control of another creature, you must make an Intelligence (Arcana) check, contested by the other creature's Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the orb and can levitate it as normal.

If the orb comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the **_gate_** spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a **portable hole**, the GM must roll a d100 to determine the outcome, using the following table. 

| d100  | Result                                                                                                                             |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01-50 | The orb is destroyed.                                                                                                              |
| 51-85 | The orb passes through the portal or into the extradimensional space.                                                               |
| 86-00 | A spatial rift sends each creature and object within 180 feet of the orb, including the orb, to a random plane of existence.        |

# Globe of Annihilation 
_Wondrous item, legendary_ 

This two-foot-diameter black globe is a rift in the multiverse, hovering in the air and held in place by a powerful magical field.

The globe annihilates all matter it passes through, and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception, unless they are vulnerable to the effects of a **Globe of Annihilation**, in which case they pass through unscathed. Anything else that touches the globe but is not completely engulfed and destroyed by it takes 4d10 force damage.

The globe remains stationary until someone takes control of it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled globe, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the globe levitates in a direction of your choice, up to a distance equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the globe moves 10 feet towards you. Any creature whose space the globe enters must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.

If you attempt to control a globe that is already under the control of another creature, you must make an Intelligence (Arcana) check, contested by the other creature's Intelligence (Arcana) check. The victor of the contest gains control of the globe and can levitate it as normal.

If the globe comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the **_gate_** spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a **portable hole**, the GM must roll a d100 to determine the outcome, using the following table. 

| d100  | Result                                                                                                                             |
