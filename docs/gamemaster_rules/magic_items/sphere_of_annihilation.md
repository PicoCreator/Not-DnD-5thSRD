# Orb of Annihilation
_Wondrous item, legendary_

This 2-foot-diameter black orb is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.

The orb obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is vulnerable to damage from an **orb of annihilation**, it passes through the orb unscathed. Anything else that touches the orb but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.

The orb is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled orb, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the orb levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 Ã— your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the orb moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the orb enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.

If you attempt to control an orb that is under another creature's control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature's Intelligence (Arcana) check. The victor of the contest gains control of the orb and can levitate it as normal.

If the orb comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the **_gate_** spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a **portable hole**, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.
