# Staff of Enchantment
_Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)_ 

Whilst holding this staff, you may expend one of its ten charges to cast **_charm person_**, **_command_**, or **_comprehend languages_** from it using your spell save DC. The staff may also be used as a magical quarterstaff.

Should you be holding the staff and fail a saving throw against an enchantment spell that targets only you, you may turn your failed save into a successful one. You may not use this property of the staff again until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment spell that targets only you, with or without the staff's intervention, you may use your reaction to expend one charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.

The staff regains one to eight plus two expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a one, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.
