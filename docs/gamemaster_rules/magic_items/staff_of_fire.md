# Staff of Flame
_Staff, exceedingly rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)_ 

You are granted resistance to fire damage while you wield this staff.

The staff is imbued with 10 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: **_blazing hands_** (1 charge), **_fireblast_** (3 charges), or **_wall of flame_** (4 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff darkens, crumbles into ashes, and is destroyed.
