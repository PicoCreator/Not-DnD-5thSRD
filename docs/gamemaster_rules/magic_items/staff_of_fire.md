# Staff of Flame
_Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)_

Whilst holding this staff, you have resistance to flame damage.

The staff has 10 charges. Whilst holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: **_burning hands_** (1 charge), **_fireball_** (3 charges), or **_wall of fire_** (4 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into ashes, and is destroyed.
