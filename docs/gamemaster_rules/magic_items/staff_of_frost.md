# Staff of Frost 
_Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)_ 

Whilst you grasp this staff, you are granted resistance to cold damage.

The staff is imbued with 10 charges. By expending one or more of its charges, you may cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: **_cone of cold_** (5 charges), **_fog cloud_** (1 charge), **_ice storm_** (4 charges), or **_wall of ice_** (4 charges).

At the break of dawn, the staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the staff is reduced to water and destroyed.
