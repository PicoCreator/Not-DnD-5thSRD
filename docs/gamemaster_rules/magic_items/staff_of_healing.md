# Staff of the Healer
_Staff, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or bard)_

This staff has 10 charges. Whilst holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: **_Cure Wounds_** (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), **_Lesser Restoration_** (2 charges), or **_Mass Cure Wounds_** (5 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever.
