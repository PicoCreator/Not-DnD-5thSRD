# The Staff of Renewal
_Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, or druid)_ 

This staff is imbued with the power of healing, and has 10 charges. When held, one may expend one or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells: **_cure wounds_** (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), **_lesser restoration_** (2 charges), or **_mass cure wounds_** (5 charges).

At the break of dawn, the staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges. If the last charge is expended, a roll of a d20 must be made. If a 1 is rolled, the staff will vanish in a flash of light, never to be seen again.
