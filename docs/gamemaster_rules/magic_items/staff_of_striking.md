# Rod of Smiting
_Staff, very rare (requires attunement)_

This staff can be wielded as a magical quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The rod has 10 charges. When you strike with a melee attack using it, you can expend up to 3 of its charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra 1d6 force damage. The rod regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at sunrise. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the rod becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.
