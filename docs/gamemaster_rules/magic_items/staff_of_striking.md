# Rod of Smiting
_Staff, of great rarity (requires attunement)_

This staff can be wielded as a magical quarterstaff, granting a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The staff holds 10 charges. When you strike with a melee attack using it, you may expend up to 3 of its charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an additional 1d6 force damage. The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the staff becomes a mundane quarterstaff.
