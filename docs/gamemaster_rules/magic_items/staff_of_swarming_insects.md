# Rod of Swarming Insects 
_Rod, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)_ 

This rod has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, a swarm of insects consumes and destroys the rod, then disperses.

**Spells.** While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: **_giant insect_** (4 charges) or **_insect plague_** (5 charges).

**Insect Cloud.** While holding the rod, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause a swarm of harmless flying insects to spread out in a 30-foot radius from you. The insects remain for 10 minutes, making the area heavily obscured for creatures other than you. The swarm moves with you, remaining centered on you. A gust of wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses the swarm and ends the effect.
