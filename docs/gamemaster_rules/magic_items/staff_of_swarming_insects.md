Type: Staff

# Staff of Swarming Insects 
_Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)_ 

This staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges each morn. If the last charge is used, roll a d20. On a 1, a swarm of insects will consume and destroy the staff, then disperse.

**Spells.** Whilst holding the staff, an action can be used to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: **_giant insect_** (4 charges) or **_insect plague_** (5 charges).

**Insect Cloud.** Whilst holding the staff, an action and 1 charge can be used to cause a swarm of harmless flying insects to spread out in a 30-foot radius from you. The insects remain for 10 minutes, making the area heavily obscured for creatures other than you. The swarm moves with you, remaining centered on you. A wind of at least 10 miles per hour will disperse the swarm and end the effect.
