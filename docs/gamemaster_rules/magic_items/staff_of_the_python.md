name: Staff of the Serpent
type: staff

# Staff of the Serpent 
_Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or warlock)_ 

By uttering the command word and throwing the staff to the ground within 10 feet of you, you can use an action to transform the staff into a giant constrictor snake under your control. With a bonus action, you can speak the command word again to return the staff to its original form in the space formerly occupied by the snake.

You can mentally command the snake if it is within 60 feet of you and you are not incapacitated. You can decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your foes or guard a certain area.

Should the snake be reduced to 0 hit points, it will perish and revert to its staff form. The staff will then shatter and be destroyed. If the snake reverts to its staff form before losing all its hit points, it will regain them all.
