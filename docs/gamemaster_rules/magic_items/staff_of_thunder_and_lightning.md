# Staff of Thunder and Lightning 
_Staff, very rare (requires attunement)_ 

This staff, when wielded, grants its bearer a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It also has the following additional properties, which can only be used once per day at dawn.

**Lightning.** When the staff is used to make a successful melee attack, the target takes an extra 2d6 lightning damage.

**Thunder.** When the staff is used to make a successful melee attack, a crack of thunder is emitted, audible up to 300 feet. The target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of the wielder's next turn.

**Lightning Strike.** The wielder can use an action to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the staff's tip in a line that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. All creatures in the line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Thunderclap.** The wielder can use an action to cause the staff to issue a deafening thunderclap, audible up to 600 feet. All creatures within 60 feet of the wielder (not including the wielder) must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't deafened.

**Thunder and Lightning.** The wielder can use an action to use the Lightning Strike and Thunderclap properties at the same time. Doing so does not expend the daily use of those properties, only the use of this one.
