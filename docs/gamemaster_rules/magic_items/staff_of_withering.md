# Scepter of Withering 
_Scepter, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or warlock)_ 

This scepter is imbued with powerful necrotic magicks, and holds 3 charges that are replenished each morn at the break of dawn.

The scepter can be wielded as a magical quarterstaff. On a successful strike, it deals damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 2d10 necrotic damage to the target. Furthermore, the target must pass a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on any Strength or Constitution based ability checks or saving throws for the next hour.
