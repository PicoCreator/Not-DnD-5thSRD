# The Stone of Commanding Earthly Spirits
_A wondrous item of rare power_

If the stone is placed upon the ground, one may use an action to utter its secret word and summon an earth elemental, as if one had cast the **_summon elemental_** spell. The stone cannot be used again until the next morn. The stone weighs 5 pounds.
