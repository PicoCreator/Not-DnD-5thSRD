# The Glorious Sunblade 
_Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)_ 

This item appears to be a longsword hilt, but when grasped, a blade of pure radiance springs forth. Those who are proficient with shortswords or longswords are also proficient with the **Glorious Sunblade**.

The wielder of this weapon is granted a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls, and the blade deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When the blade strikes an undead, it deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

The blade emits a bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. This light is as bright as the sun. The wielder can use an action to expand or reduce the radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.
