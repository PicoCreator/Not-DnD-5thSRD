# Sun Blade 
_Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)_ 

This item appears to be a longsword hilt. When grasped, a blade of pure radiance can be summoned with a bonus action, or made to disappear. Those proficient with shortswords or longswords are also proficient with the **sun blade**.

The wielder of this weapon gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls, and deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When used to strike an undead, it deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

The blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. This light is of the same intensity as sunlight. An action can be used to expand or reduce the radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, up to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.
