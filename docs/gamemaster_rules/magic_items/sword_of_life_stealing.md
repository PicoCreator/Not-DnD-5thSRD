# Sword of Life-Draining
_Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)_

When you strike a creature with this enchanted weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, the target takes an additional 3d6 necrotic damage, so long as the target is not a construct or an undead. You gain temporary hit points equal to the extra damage dealt.
