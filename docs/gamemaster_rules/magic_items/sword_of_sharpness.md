# Sword of Splendour
_Weapon (any sword that deals slashing damage), very rare (requires attunement)_

When you wield this enchanted blade and strike an object, your weapon damage dice are maximised against the target.

When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 4d6 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you sever one of the target's limbs, with the consequences of such loss determined by the Game Master. If the creature has no limb to sever, you instead lop off a portion of its body.

Furthermore, you can utter the sword's command word to cause the blade to emit a brilliant light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Uttering the command word again or sheathing the sword extinguishes the light.
