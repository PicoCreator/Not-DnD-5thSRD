Name: Sword of Sharpness 
Type: Weapon 

# Sword of Sharpness 
_Weapon (any sword that deals slashing damage), very rare (requires attunement)_ 

When you strike an object with this enchanted blade and hit, your weapon damage dice are maximized against the target. 

When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 4d6 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you sever one of the target's limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the GM. If the creature has no limb to cut off, you instead lop off a portion of its body. 

In addition, you can utter the sword's command word to cause the blade to emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Uttering the command word again or sheathing the sword extinguishes the light.
