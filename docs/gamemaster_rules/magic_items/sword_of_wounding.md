# Sword of Wounding
_Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)_

Any damage inflicted by this weapon cannot be healed by regeneration, magic, or any other means, but can be restored through a short or long rest.

When you hit a creature with an attack using this magical weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time it has been wounded, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.
