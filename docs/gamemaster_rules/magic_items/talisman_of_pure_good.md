# Talisman of Pure Virtue
_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)_

This talisman is a powerful symbol of goodness. Any creature that is neither good nor evil in alignment will suffer 6d6 radiant damage upon touching the talisman. An evil creature will suffer 8d6 radiant damage upon touching the talisman. Either sort of creature will suffer the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.

If you are a good cleric or paladin, you may use the talisman as a holy symbol, and you shall gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it.

The talisman has 7 charges. If you are wearing or holding it, you may use an action to expend 1 charge from it and choose one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the target is of evil alignment, a flaming fissure shall open beneath it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the fissure and be destroyed, leaving no remains. The fissure shall then close, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman shall disperse into motes of golden light and be destroyed.
