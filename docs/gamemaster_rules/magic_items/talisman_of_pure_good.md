# The Amulet of Righteousness
_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)_ 

This amulet is a powerful symbol of goodness. Any creature that is neither good nor evil in alignment will suffer 6d6 radiant damage upon touching the amulet. An evil creature will suffer 8d6 radiant damage upon touching the amulet. Either sort of creature will suffer the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the amulet.

If you are a good cleric or paladin, you can use the amulet as a holy symbol, and you will be granted a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it.

The amulet has 7 charges. If you are wearing or holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from it and choose one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the target is of evil alignment, a blazing fissure will open beneath it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be cast into the fissure and be destroyed, leaving no remains. The fissure will then close, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the amulet will disperse into motes of golden light and be destroyed.
