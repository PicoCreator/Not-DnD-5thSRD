# The Amulet of Unspeakable Darkness
_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of evil alignment)_ 

This item is a symbol of the darkest of evils. Any creature that is neither good nor evil in alignment will suffer 6d6 necrotic damage upon touching the amulet. A good creature will suffer 8d6 necrotic damage upon touching the amulet. Either sort of creature will suffer the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the amulet.

If you are an evil cleric or paladin, you may use the amulet as a holy symbol, and you shall be granted a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it.

The amulet has 6 charges. If you are wearing or holding it, you may use an action to expend 1 charge from the amulet and choose one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the target is of good alignment, a fissure of blazing flames shall open beneath them. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be consumed by the fissure, leaving no trace of their existence. When the last charge is expended, the amulet shall dissolve into a putrid slime and be destroyed.
