# Talisman of Dreadful Malice
_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of evil alignment)_

This item is a symbol of unmitigated wickedness. Any creature that is neither good nor evil in alignment will suffer 6d6 necrotic damage upon touching the talisman. A good creature will suffer 8d6 necrotic damage upon touching the talisman. Either sort of creature will suffer the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.

If you are an evil cleric or paladin, you may use the talisman as a holy symbol, and you will gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it.

The talisman has 6 charges. If you are wearing or holding it, you may use an action to expend 1 charge from the talisman and choose one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the target is of good alignment, a blazing crevice will open beneath it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the crevice and be destroyed, leaving no remains. The crevice will then close, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman will dissolve into a noisome slime and be destroyed.
