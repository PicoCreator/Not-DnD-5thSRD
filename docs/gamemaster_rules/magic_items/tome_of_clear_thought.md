# Tome of Clear Thinking
_Wondrous item, very rare_

This tome contains exercises of memory and logic, and its words are imbued with magic. If one spends 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its teachings, their Intelligence score increases by 2, as does their maximum for that score. The manual then loses its enchantment, but regains it after a century.
