# Tome of Command and Persuasion
_Wondrous item, very rare_

This tome contains instructions for swaying and charming others, and its words are imbued with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and applying its teachings, your Charisma score will increase by 2, as will its maximum. The manual then loses its enchantment, but will regain it in a century.
