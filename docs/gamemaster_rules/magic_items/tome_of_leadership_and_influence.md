# The Tome of Leadership and Influence
_A wondrous item of great rarity_

This tome contains the secrets of swaying and beguiling others, and its words are imbued with powerful magic. Should one spend six days or fewer, studying the book's contents and practicing its teachings, their Charisma score shall be increased by two, as shall their maximum for that score. The manual shall then lose its enchantment, but shall regain it after a century.
