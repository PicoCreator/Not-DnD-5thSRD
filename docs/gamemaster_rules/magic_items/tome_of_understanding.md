# Tome of Enlightenment
_Wondrous item, very rare_

This tome is filled with exercises of insight and intuition, and its words are imbued with powerful magic. If one spends six days or fewer, studying the contents of the book and practicing its teachings, their Wisdom score will be increased by two, as will their maximum score. After this, the book will lose its magical properties, but will regain them after a century.
