# Tome of Insight
_Wondrous item, very rare_

This tome holds exercises of intuition and understanding, and its words are imbued with magic. If one spends 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its teachings, their Wisdom score will increase by 2, as will their maximum for that score. The manual then loses its enchantment, but regains it after a century.
