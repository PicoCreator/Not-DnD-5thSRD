# Vorpal Blade
_Weapon (any sword that deals slashing damage), legendary (requires attunement)_

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon. Furthermore, it ignores any resistance to slashing damage.

When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you sever one of the creature's heads. The creature will perish if it cannot survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, does not have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too large for its head to be cut off with this weapon. In such a case, the creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.
