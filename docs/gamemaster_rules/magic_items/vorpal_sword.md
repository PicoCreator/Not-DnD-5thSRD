# Excalibur
_Weapon (any sword that deals slashing damage), legendary (requires attunement)_

The wielder of this magical weapon is granted a boon of +3 to their attack and damage rolls. Furthermore, the weapon is capable of cutting through any resistance to slashing damage.

When the wielder of Excalibur strikes a creature with at least one head and rolls a 20 on the attack roll, the creature's head is severed from its body. The creature is slain if it cannot survive without its head. However, if the creature is immune to slashing damage, does not possess a head, has legendary actions, or is too large for its head to be cut off, it is instead dealt an additional 6d8 slashing damage.
