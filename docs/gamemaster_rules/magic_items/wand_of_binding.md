**Spells.** While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): **_imprisonment_** (5 charges) or **_confine_** (2 charges).

**Assisted Escape.** While holding the staff, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and gain advantage on a saving throw you make to avoid being paralyzed or restrained, or you can expend 1 charge and gain advantage on any check you make to escape a grapple.
