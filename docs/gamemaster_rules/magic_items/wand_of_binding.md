# The Binding Rod
_Rod, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)_ 

This rod is imbued with 7 charges, which are replenished each day at the break of dawn. If the last charge is expended, a roll of a d20 must be made; on a roll of 1, the rod crumbles into dust and is destroyed.

**Spells.** While in possession of the rod, one may use an action to expend some of its charges to cast either **_hold monster_** (5 charges) or **_hold person_** (2 charges).

**Assisted Escape.** While in possession of the rod, one may use their reaction to expend 1 charge and gain advantage on a saving throw to avoid being paralyzed or restrained, or to gain advantage on any check made to escape a grapple.
