# Rod of Foe Detection
_Rod, rare (requires attunement)_

This rod has 7 charges. When held, one may use an action and expend a single charge to utter its command word. For the next minute, the direction of the nearest hostile creature within 60 feet is known, but not its distance. The rod can sense the presence of hostile creatures that are ethereal, invisible, disguised, or hidden, as well as those in plain sight. The effect ends when the rod is no longer held.

The rod regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If the last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the rod crumbles into dust and is destroyed.
