# Mystic Rod of Enemy Detection
_Rod, rare (requires attunement)_

This mystic rod is imbued with 7 charges. When held, one may use an action and expend a single charge to utter its command word. For the next minute, the wielder will be aware of the direction of the nearest hostile creature within 60 feet, though not its distance. The rod can detect the presence of hostile creatures, whether they be ethereal, invisible, disguised, or hidden, as well as those in plain sight. The effect will cease if the rod is no longer held.

The rod regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If all charges are expended, a d20 must be rolled. On a roll of 1, the rod will crumble into ashes and be destroyed.
