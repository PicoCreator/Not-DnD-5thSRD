# The Fearful Wand
_Wand, rare (requires attunement)_

This wand has 7 charges, which are replenished each day at dawn with 1d6 + 1 charges. If the last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the wand is destroyed and turns to ash.

**Command.** When holding the wand, you may expend 1 charge and use an action to command another creature to flee or cower, as with the **_command_** spell (save DC 15).

**Cone of Fear.** When holding the wand, you may expend 2 charges and use an action to cause the wand's tip to emit a 60-foot cone of amber light. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, the creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as possible, and it cannot willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also cannot take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or attempt to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
