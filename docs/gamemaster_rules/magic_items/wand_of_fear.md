# The Mystic Sceptre
_Sceptre, rare (requires attunement)_

This sceptre is imbued with 7 charges, which are replenished each day at the break of dawn. If the last charge is expended, a roll of a d20 must be made; on a roll of 1, the sceptre is reduced to ashes and destroyed.

**Command.** When the sceptre is held, an action can be used to expend a single charge and command another creature to flee or cower, as with the **_command_** spell (save DC 15).

**Cone of Fear.** When the sceptre is held, an action can be used to expend two charges, causing the tip of the sceptre to emit a 60-foot cone of amber light. Every creature within the cone must pass a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be filled with dread of the wielder for one minute. During this time, the creature must attempt to move away from the wielder as far as possible, and cannot willingly move within 30 feet of the wielder. Additionally, the creature cannot take reactions, and can only use the Dash action or attempt to escape from an effect that prevents movement. If the creature has nowhere to move, the Dodge action can be used. At the end of each turn, the creature can attempt the saving throw again, ending the effect on a success.
