# The Mystic Sceptre of Fireballs
_Sceptre, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)_

This mystic sceptre holds seven charges of power. When held, one may use an action to expend one or more of its charges to cast the **_fireball_** spell (save DC 15) from it. For one charge, the spell is cast at the third-level. For each additional charge expended, the spell slot level increases by one.

The sceptre regains one to six plus one expended charges daily at dawn. If the last charge is expended, a roll of a d20 is required. On a roll of one, the sceptre crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
