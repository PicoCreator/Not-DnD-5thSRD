# The Mystic Wand of Magic Missiles
_Wand, Uncommon_

This wand is imbued with the power of seven charges. When held, one may use an action to expend one or more of its charges to cast the **_magic missile_** spell. For one charge, the spell is cast at the first level. The potency of the spell can be increased by one level for each additional charge expended.

At the break of dawn, the wand regains its power with 1d6 + 1 charges. If the last charge is expended, a roll of a d20 is required. If a one is rolled, the wand is destroyed and reduced to ashes.
