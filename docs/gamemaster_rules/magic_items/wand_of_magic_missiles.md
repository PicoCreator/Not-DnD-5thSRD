# Wand of Mystic Missiles
_Wand, uncommon_

This wand holds 7 charges. By using an action, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the **_mystic missile_** spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.
