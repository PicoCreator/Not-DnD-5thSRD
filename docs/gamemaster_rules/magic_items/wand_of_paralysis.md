Name: The Staff of Immobilization
Type: Staff, Rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)

# The Staff of Immobilization

This staff is imbued with 7 charges. When held, one may use an action to expend one of its charges and send forth a thin blue ray from the tip of the staff towards a creature within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, they may attempt the saving throw again, ending the effect on a success.

The staff regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If the last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the staff crumbles into dust and is destroyed.
