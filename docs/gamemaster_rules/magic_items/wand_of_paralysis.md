# Wand of Stasis
_Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)_

This wand holds 7 charges. When held, you can use an action to expend one of its charges and send forth a thin blue ray from the tip towards a creature you can see within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, they can attempt the saving throw again, ending the effect on a success.

The wand regains 1d6+1 expended charges daily at dawn. If the last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
