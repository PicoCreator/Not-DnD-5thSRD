# Polymorphic Wand
_Wand, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)_

This wand has 7 charges. Whilst holding it, you may use an action to expend one of its charges to cast the **_polymorph_** spell (save DC 15) from it.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.
