# The Wand of Transformation
_Wand, of a very rare nature (requires attunement by a spellcaster)_

This wand is endowed with seven charges. While in possession of it, you may expend one of its charges to cast the **_polymorph_** spell (save DC 15) from it.

At the break of dawn, the wand regains one to six plus one expended charges. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of one, the wand will be reduced to ashes and destroyed.
