# Mystic Scepter
_Scepter, uncommon_

This scepter is imbued with a mysterious power, granting it three charges. When held, the wielder may expend one of its charges as an action. If a secret door or trap lies within 30 feet, the scepter will pulse and point towards the nearest one. At the break of dawn, the scepter will regain 1d3 expended charges.
