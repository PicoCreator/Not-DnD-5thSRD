# The Enchanted Rod of Cobwebs
_Rod, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)_

This rod is imbued with 7 charges. While holding it, you may use an action to expend one of its charges to cast the **_web_** spell (save DC 15) from it.

The rod regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at the break of dawn. If you expend the rod's last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the rod crumbles into dust and is destroyed.
