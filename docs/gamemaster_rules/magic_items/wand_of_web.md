# Staff of Spiders
_Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)_

This staff has 7 charges. Whilst holding it, you can use an action to expend one of its charges to cast the **_web_** spell (save DC 15) from it.

The staff regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the staff's last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the staff crumbles into dust and is destroyed.
