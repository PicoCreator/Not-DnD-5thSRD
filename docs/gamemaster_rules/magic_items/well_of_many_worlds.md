# The Well of Many Worlds
_Wondrous Item, Legendary_

This fine black cloth, as soft as silk, is folded up to the size of a handkerchief. When unfolded, it is a circular sheet of six feet in diameter.

By using an action, one can place the Well of Many Worlds on a solid surface, and it will create a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. The GM will decide where the portal leads each time it is opened. To close the portal, one must take hold of the edges of the cloth and fold it up, using an action. The Well of Many Worlds cannot open a portal again for 1d8 hours after it has been opened.
