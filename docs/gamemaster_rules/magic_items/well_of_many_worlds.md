# The Well of Many Worlds

This fine black cloth, as soft as the finest silk, is folded up to the size of a handkerchief. When unfolded, it reveals a circular sheet of six feet in diameter.

By using an action, one can place the Well of Many Worlds upon a solid surface, whereupon it will create a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item is used, the GM will decide where the portal leads. To close the portal, one must take hold of the edges of the cloth and fold it up. Once the Well of Many Worlds has opened a portal, it cannot do so again for 1d8 hours.
