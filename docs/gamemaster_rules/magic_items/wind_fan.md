# Wind Fan
_A wondrous item of uncommon power_

When this fan is held, its wielder may use an action to cast the spell of **_Gust of Wind_** (save DC 13). After use, the fan must be left to rest until the next dawn. If it is used again before then, there is a cumulative 20% chance that it will tear into useless, nonmagical tatters.
