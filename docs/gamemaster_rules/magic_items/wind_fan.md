# Wind Fan
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

Whilst holding this fan, you may use an action to cast the **_Gust of Wind_** spell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan should not be used again until the next morn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical scraps.
