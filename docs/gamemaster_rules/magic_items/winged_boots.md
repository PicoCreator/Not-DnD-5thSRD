# Winged Shoes
_Marvellous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

Whilst you wear these shoes, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the shoes to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.

The shoes regain 2 hours of flying capability for every 12 hours they aren't in use.
