# Winged Slippers
_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

When you don these slippers, you are granted the power of flight, with a speed equal to your walking speed. You may use the slippers to fly for up to four hours, either in one long flight or in several shorter ones, each taking at least one minute of the duration. If you are still in the air when the duration expires, you will descend at a rate of thirty feet per round until you reach the ground.

The slippers will regain two hours of flight capability for every twelve hours they are not in use.
