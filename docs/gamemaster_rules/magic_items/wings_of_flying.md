# Wings of Soaring
_A wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

When wearing this cloak, you may use an action to utter its command word. This will cause the cloak to transform into a pair of wings, either of a bat or a bird, which will remain on your back for an hour or until you speak the command word again as an action. These wings grant you a flying speed of 60 feet. After they vanish, you cannot use them again for 1d12 hours.
