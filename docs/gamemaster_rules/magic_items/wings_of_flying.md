# Wings of the Heavens 
_A wondrous item of rare beauty, requiring attunement_ 

When donning this cloak, one may speak its command word as an action. Upon doing so, a pair of wings, be they of a bat or a bird, shall appear upon one's back for an hour, or until the command word is spoken again. These wings grant a speed of flight of 60 feet, and when they disappear, they cannot be used again for 1d12 hours.
