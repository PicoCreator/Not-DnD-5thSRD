# Rules for Monstrous Beings
The vital information required to bring a monstrous being to life is contained within its **stat block**. 

These statistics provide the necessary details to traverse the fantastical realms of this game world, and to encounter the creatures that inhabit it. 

From the mightiest of dragons to the most diminutive of sprites, each creature has its own unique set of characteristics that must be taken into account when engaging with them. 

Be it in battle or in conversation, the knowledge of a monster's stat block is essential for any adventurer who wishes to survive the perils of this world.
## Magnitude
A beast may be diminutive, petite, average, sizable, colossal, or titanic. The Magnitude Categories table reveals the amount of space a creature of a certain magnitude commands in battle. Consult the **Player's Tome** for additional information on creature magnitude and area.

>### Customizing Creatures 
>Though this tome contains a vast array of monsters, you may find yourself at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for your adventure. Feel free to alter an existing creature to make it more suitable for your needs, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from another monster or by using a **variant** or **template**, such as those found in this book. Bear in mind that modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it, may alter its challenge rating.
## Type
Creatures of the realm come in many shapes and sizes, each with their own unique nature. Spells, magical items, and other effects in the game interact differently with creatures of a certain type. For example, a **dragon-slaying arrow** is especially effective against dragons, as well as other dragon-like creatures such as dragon turtles and wyverns.

The game includes the following monster types, each with their own special characteristics:

**Aberrations** are strange and alien beings, often possessing innate magical powers. Aboleths and slaadi are two of the most iconic aberrations.

**Beasts** are non-humanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy world. Most are unintelligent and lack any language or culture, and include all varieties of animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.

**Celestials** are creatures native to the Upper Planes, often employed as messengers or agents of the gods. Celestials are good by nature, and an evil celestial is a rare and terrifying sight. Angels, couatls, and pegasi are all examples of celestials.

**Constructs** are made, not born. Some are programmed to follow simple instructions, while others are sentient and capable of independent thought. Golems are the most iconic constructs, and many creatures native to the plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are also constructs.

**Dragons** are powerful reptilian creatures of ancient origin. True dragons, such as metallic and chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and possess innate magic. Other dragon-like creatures, such as wyverns and pseudodragons, are less powerful and less magical.

**Elementals** are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, while others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. Genies, such as djinn and efreet, are the most important civilizations on the elemental planes, and other elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.

**Fey** are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in forests and groves, and in some worlds are connected to the Feywild. Dryads, pixies, and satyrs are all examples of fey.

**Fiends** are wicked creatures native to the Lower Planes. Many are the servants of archdevils and demon princes, and are sometimes summoned to the material world by evil priests and mages. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.

**Giants** are huge human-like creatures. True giants come in six varieties: hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Other giant-like creatures include ogres and trolls.

**Humanoids** are the main peoples of a fantasy world, both civilized and savage. They have language and culture, and are bipedal. The most common humanoid races are humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Other humanoid races, such as goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds, are more savage and evil.

**Monstrosities** are monsters in the strictest sense--frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry, while others are the product of terrible curses. Owlbears and minotaurs are two examples of monstrosities.

**Oozes** are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They dwell in caves and dungeons and feed on anything they can find. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are two of the most recognizable oozes.

**Plants** are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. Shambling mounds and treants are two of the most iconic plants, and other plant-like creatures include gas spores and myconids.

**Undead** are once-living creatures brought to a state of undeath through necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters. 

### Tags
Monsters may be adorned with one or more tags, denoted in parentheses, to further categorize them. For instance, an orc may be classified as a humanoid (orc). These tags are not rules unto themselves, but may be referenced by other elements of the game, such as magical items. For example, a spear that is particularly effective against demons would be effective against any monster that has the demon tag.

## Alignment
A monster's alignment provides an indication of its behavior and attitude in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster may be difficult to reason with and may attack characters on sight, while a neutral monster may be more willing to negotiate.

The alignment specified in a monster's stat block is the default, but it can be changed to suit the needs of the campaign. If you wish to have a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, you are free to do so.

Some creatures may have **any alignment**, meaning that you can choose the monster's alignment. Some monster's alignment entry may indicate a tendency or aversion towards law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker may be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), in keeping with its wild nature.

Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They act on instinct, and are thus unaligned, meaning they have no alignment.

## Armor Class
A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster's AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.

## Hit Points
A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points.

A monster's hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 × 4½).

A monster's size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.

### Hit Dice by Size
| Monster Size | Hit Die | Average HP per Die |
|--------------|---------|--------------------|
| Tiny         | d4      | 2 1/2              |
| Small        | d6      | 3 1/2              |
| Medium       | d8      | 4 1/2              |
| Large        | d10     | 5 1/2              |
| Huge         | d12     | 6 1/2              |
| Gargantuan   | d20     | 10 1/2             |

A monster's Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).

## Speed
A monster's speed tells you how far it can move on its turn.

All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster's speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet. Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.

### Burrowing
Monsters with a burrowing speed can traverse through sand, earth, mud, or ice with ease. However, they cannot pass through solid rock unless they possess a special trait that allows them to do so. 

### Climbing
Creatures with a climbing speed can use all or part of their movement to ascend vertical surfaces without expending extra effort. 

### Flight
Beasts with a flying speed can use all or part of their movement to soar through the air. Some monsters have the ability to hover, making them difficult to dislodge from the sky. When such a creature dies, it ceases hovering. 

### Swimming
Monsters with a swimming speed do not need to expend extra movement to traverse through water. 

## Attributes
Every monster has six attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and their corresponding modifiers. 

## Saving Throws 
The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that is not easily swayed by charm or fear may be granted a boon on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures do not possess special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.

A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster's relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster's challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).

### Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating
| Challenge | Proficiency Bonus |
|-----------|:------------------|
| 0         | +2                |

| 30        | +9                |

## Skills 
The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is particularly perceptive and stealthy may be granted bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

A skill bonus is the sum of a monster's relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster's challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers may also apply. For instance, a monster may have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise. 

## Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies 
It is assumed that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you choose to replace them, you must decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment.

For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and decide whether the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither. 

## Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities 
Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures may even be resistant or immune to damage from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some creatures are immune to certain conditions. 

## Senses 
The Senses entry notes a monster's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might possess. Special senses are described below.

### Blindsight 
A beast with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a certain distance.

Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically possess this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.

If a monster is naturally blind, it is noted with a parenthetical, indicating that the range of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception. 

### Darkvision 
A creature with darkvision can see in the dark within a certain radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that dwell underground have this special sense. 

### Tremorsense 
A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the source of vibrations within a certain distance, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense cannot be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs, possess this special sense. 

### Truesight 
A monster with truesight can, out to a certain range, see in normal and magical darkness, detect invisible creatures and objects, automatically recognize visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range. 

## Languages 
The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but cannot speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A "--" indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language. 

### Telepathy 
Telepathy is a mystical power that allows a creature to communicate with another being without the need for words. This connection is established between two creatures within a certain range, and the creature contacted does not need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this manner. Those without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages, but cannot initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.

A telepathic monster does not need to see the creature it is contacting, and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without expending any effort, but while the monster is incapacitated, it cannot initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.

A creature within the area of an **_antimagic field_** or in any other location where magic does not function cannot send or receive telepathic messages.

## Challenge 
A monster's **challenge rating** indicates how great a threat it poses. A party of four adventurers, suitably equipped and well-rested, should be able to defeat a monster with a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any fatalities. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.

Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st- level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.

Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill. 

### Experience Points 
The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner. Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.

#### Experience Points by Challenge Rating
| Challenge | XP      |
|-----------|---------|
| 0         | 0 or 10 |

## Special Traits 
Special traits (which appear after a monster's challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation. 

### Innate Spellcasting 
A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and cannot be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster's challenge rating.

An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the **_levitate_** spell, but the spell has a "self only" restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.

A monster's innate spells cannot be swapped out with other spells. If a monster's innate spells do not require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.

## Special Traits 
Special traits (which appear after a monster's challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation. 

### Innate Spellcasting 
A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and cannot be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster's challenge rating.

An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the **_levitate_** spell, but the spell has a "self only" restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.

A monster's innate spells cannot be replaced with other spells. If a monster's innate spells do not require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.
### Spellcasting
Monsters with the Spellcasting special trait possess a spellcaster level and spell slots, which they use to cast their spells of 1st level and higher. This spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.

The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class. This list may also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to or using a magical item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list.

A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level **_lightning bolt_** spell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level spell slots.

You can alter the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you may cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating. 

### Psionics 
A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game may refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically does not require any components to cast its spells. 

## Actions 
When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action. 

### Melee and Ranged Attacks 
The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the "weapon" might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike.

**Creature vs. Target.** The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a "target" can be a creature or an object.

**Hit.** Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the "**Hit**" notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.

**Miss.** If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the "**Miss:**" notation. 

### Multiattack 
A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature cannot use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack. 

### Ammunition 
A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow. 

## Reactions 
If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent. 

## Limited Usage 
Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.

**X/Day.** The notation "X/Day" means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must complete a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, "1/Day" means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must complete a long rest to use it again.

**Recharge X–Y.** The notation "Recharge X–Y" means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster's turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster completes a short or long rest.

For example, "Recharge 5–6" means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster's turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.

**Recharge after a Short or Long Rest.** This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must complete a short or long rest to use it again. 

## Grapple Rules for Monsters 
Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it does not need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.

A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster's stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster's Strength (Athletics) modifier. 

## Equipment 
A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.

You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monster's equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance. If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.
