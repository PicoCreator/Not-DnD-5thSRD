**Amphibious.** The wyrm can breathe air and water.    
**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the wyrm fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. 

### Actions 
**Multiattack.** The wyrm can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.    
**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 20 (2d10 + 9) piercing damage.    
**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 16 (2d6 + 9) slashing damage.    
**Tail.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 18 (2d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage.    
**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the wyrm's choice that is within 120 feet of the wyrm and aware of it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the wyrm's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.    
**Breath Weapons (Recharge 5–6).** The wyrm uses one of the following breath weapons.    
**Lightning Breath.** The wyrm exhales lightning in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 88 (16d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.    
**Repulsion Breath.** The wyrm exhales repulsion energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 60 feet away from the wyrm.    
**Change Shape.** The wyrm magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the wyrm's choice).    
In a new form, the wyrm retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form. 

### Legendary Actions 
The wyrm can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The wyrm regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.    
**Detect.** The wyrm makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.    
**Tail Attack.** The wyrm makes a tail attack.    
**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The wyrm beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the wyrm must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The wyrm can then fly up to half its flying speed.
