**Ice Stride.** The wyrm can traverse and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow does not impede its movement.    
**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the wyrm fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. 

### Actions 
**Multiattack.** The wyrm can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.    
**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage.    
**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.    
**Tail.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.    
**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the wyrm's choice that is within 120 feet of the wyrm and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the wyrm's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.    
**Frost Breath (Recharge 5â€“6).** The wyrm exhales an icy blast in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

### Legendary Actions 
The wyrm can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The wyrm regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.    
**Discern.** The wyrm makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.    
**Tail Strike.** The wyrm makes a tail attack.    
**Wing Buffet (Costs 2 Actions).** The wyrm beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the wyrm must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The wyrm can then fly up to half its flying speed.
