### Description
Archmagi are powerful (and oftentimes quite aged) spellcasters devoted to the study of the arcane arts. Kindly ones counsel kings and queens, while wicked ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice their magic without interruption. An archmagus typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmagus's abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.
