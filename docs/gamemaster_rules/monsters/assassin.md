**Sneak Attack.** Once per turn, the assassin deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the assassin that isn't incapacitated and the assassin doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

### Description
Trained in the use of poison, assassins are merciless killers who work for nobles, guildmasters, sovereigns, and anyone else who can afford them. 

Upon its first turn, the Assassin has an advantage on attack rolls against any creature that has not yet taken a turn. Any hit the Assassin scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit. If the Assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the Assassin instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. Once per turn, the Assassin deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the Assassin that isn't incapacitated and the Assassin doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll. 

The Assassin is a master of poison, and can make two shortsword attacks or one light crossbow attack. If the target is hit, they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
