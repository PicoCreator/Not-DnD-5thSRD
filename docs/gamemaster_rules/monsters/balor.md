**Deathly Roar.** When the balor perishes, it detonates, and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion sets alight any flammable objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried, and it destroys the balor's weapons.    
**Fiery Aura.** At the start of each of the balor's turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage, and any flammable objects in the aura that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches the balor or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.    
**Magical Resistance.** The balor has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.    
**Magical Weapons.** The balor's weapon attacks are magical.
