### Description
Gangs of brigands roam the land, sometimes led by thugs, veterans, or spellcasters. Not all brigands are evil. Misfortune, drought, sickness, or famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry. Pirates are brigands of the high seas. They may be freebooters interested only in treasure and murder, or they may be privateers sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation's vessels.
