### Description
It takes a powerful personality, a cruel wit, and a silver tongue to keep a gang of brigands in line. The brigand captain has these qualities in abundance. In addition to managing a crew of selfish miscreants, the pirate captain is a variation of the brigand captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishments on a regular basis. More than treasure, a brigand captain or pirate captain craves notoriety. A prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain's illustrious reputation.
