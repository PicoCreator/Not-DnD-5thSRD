### Description
It takes a powerful personality, merciless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a gang of brigands in line. The brigand chief has these qualities in abundance. In addition to managing a crew of selfish miscreants, the pirate chief is a variation of the brigand chief, with a vessel to protect and command. To keep the crew in check, the chief must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis. More than treasure, a brigand chief or pirate chief craves notoriety. A prisoner who appeals to the chief's vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the chief's colourful reputation.
