**Formless.** The blob can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
**Corrosive Nature.** A creature that touches the blob or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that hits the blob corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood that hits the blob is destroyed after dealing damage.
The blob can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical wood or metal in 1 round.
**Climbing.** The blob can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions 
**Tentacle.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) acid damage. In addition, nonmagical armour worn by the target is partly dissolved and takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armour is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10. 

### Reactions 
**Divide.** When a blob that is Medium or larger is subjected to lightning or slashing damage, it splits into two new blobs if it has at least 10 hit points. Each new blob has hit points equal to half the original blob's, rounded down. New blobs are one size smaller than the original blob.
