# Gloaming Ooze 
_Large ooze, unaligned_

**Armor Class** 7    
**Hit Points** 85 (10d10 + 30)    
**Speed** 20 ft., climb 20 ft. 

| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA     |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 16 (+3) | 5 (−3)  | 16 (+3) | 1 (−5)  | 6 (−2)  | 1 (−5)  |

**Damage Immunities** acid, cold, lightning, slashing    
**Condition Immunities** blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, prone    
**Senses** blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond this radius), passive Perception 8    
**Languages** --    
**Challenge** 4 (1,100 XP) 

**Amorphous Form.** The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.    
**Corrosive Nature.** A creature that touches the ooze or strikes it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that strikes the ooze corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood that strikes the ooze is destroyed after dealing damage.    
The ooze can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical wood or metal in 1 round.    
**Spider Climb.** The ooze can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. 

### Actions 
**Pseudopod.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) acid damage. In addition, nonmagical armor worn by the target is partly dissolved and takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10. 

### Reactions 
**Divide.** When a ooze that is Medium or larger is subjected to lightning or slashing damage, it splits into two new oozes if it has at least 10 hit points. Each new ooze has hit points equal to half the original ooze's, rounded down. New oozes are one size smaller than the original ooze.
