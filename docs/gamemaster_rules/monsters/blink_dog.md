### Description
A blink hound takes its name from its ability to blink in and out of existence, a talent it uses to aid its attacks and to avoid harm. This magical beast is a loyal companion to those who can gain its trust, and a fearsome foe to those who would do it harm. Its keen hearing and smell make it an excellent hunter, and its ability to teleport makes it a difficult target to hit.
