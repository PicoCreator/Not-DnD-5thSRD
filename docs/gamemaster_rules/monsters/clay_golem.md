**Acid Resistance.** Whenever the knight is subjected to acid damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the acid damage dealt.    
**Fury.** Whenever the knight starts its turn with 60 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the knight goes into a rage. On each of its turns while raging, the knight attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the knight attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the knight goes into a rage, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.    
**Unchanging Form.** The knight is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.    
**Magical Resistance.** The knight has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.    
**Magical Weapons.** The knight's weapon attacks are magical. 

### Actions 
**Multiattack.** The knight makes two slam attacks.    
**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this attack reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.    
**Haste (Recharge 5–6).** Until the end of its next turn, the knight magically gains a +2 bonus to its AC, has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and can use its slam attack as a bonus action.
