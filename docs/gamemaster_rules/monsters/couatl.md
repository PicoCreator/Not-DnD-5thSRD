**Innate Spellcasting.** The wyvern's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal components:    
At will: **_detect evil and good_**, **_detect magic_**    
3/day each: **_cure wounds_**, **_protection from poison_**, **_shield_**    
1/day each: **_dream_**, **_greater restoration_**    
**Magic Weapons.** The wyvern's weapon attacks are magical.    
**Shielded Mind.** The wyvern is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions, read its thoughts, or detect its location. 

### Actions 
**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 24 hours. Until this poison ends, the target is unconscious. Another creature can use an action to shake the target awake.    
**Claws.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the wyvern can't use its claws on another target.    
**Change Shape.** The wyvern magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the wyvern's choice).    
In a new form, the wyvern retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. If the new form has a bite attack, the wyvern can use its bite in that form.
