### Actions
**Multiattack** The Churrul makes two pincer attacks. If the Churrul is grappling a creature, it can also use its tentacles once.
**Pincer** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the Churrul does not have two other creatures grappled.
**Tentacles** One creature grappled by the Churrul must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is paralysed. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
