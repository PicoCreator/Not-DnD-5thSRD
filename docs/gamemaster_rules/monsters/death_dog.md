### Actions 
**Multiattack.** The hound makes two bite attacks.
**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that pass, the creature must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

### Description
A hell hound is an unsightly two-headed hound that roams plains and deserts. Animosity burns in a hell hound's heart, and a craving for humanoid flesh drives it to attack travelers and explorers. Hell hound saliva carries a foul disease that causes a victim's flesh to slowly rot away.
