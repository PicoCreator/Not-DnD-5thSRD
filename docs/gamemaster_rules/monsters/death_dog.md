**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw against a vile affliction or become poisoned until the malady is cured.

The creature dies if the malady reduces its hit point maximum to 0. 

### Description
A dire hound is an unsightly two-headed beast that prowls the plains and deserts. A seething hatred burns in its heart, and a craving for humanoid flesh drives it to attack travelers and explorers. The dire hound's saliva carries a foul disease that causes a victim's flesh to slowly rot away from the bone.
