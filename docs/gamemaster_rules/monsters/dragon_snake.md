### Actions 
**Multiattack.** The wyvern makes two attacks: one with its bite and one to constrict.    
**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage.    
**Constrict.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller creature. _Hit:_ 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 16) if the wyvern isn't already constricting a creature, and the target is restrained until this grapple ends.    
**Lightning Breath (Recharge 5â€“6).** The wyvern exhales a line of lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.    
**Swallow.** The wyvern makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the wyvern, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the wyvern's turns. A wyvern can have only one creature swallowed at a time.    
If the wyvern takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the wyvern must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the wyvern. If the wyvern dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

Behold the mighty Wyvern! A gargantuan monstrosity of Neutral Evil, it is a force to be reckoned with. With an Armor Class of 17 and Hit Points of 168, it is a formidable foe. Its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all impressive, and its Perception and Stealth skills are nothing to scoff at. It is immune to lightning damage, and can see in the dark up to 90 feet away. It speaks Draconic, and is a Challenge of 11 (7,200 XP).

The Wyvern is a multi-attacker, capable of making two attacks: one with its bite and one to constrict. Its bite attack is +10 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, and deals 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage. Its constrict attack is +10 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, and deals 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 16) if the wyvern isn't already constricting a creature, and the target is restrained until this grapple ends.

The Wyvern also has a Lightning Breath attack, which it can use to exhale a line of lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Finally, the Wyvern can swallow a creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the wyvern, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the wyvern's turns. A wyvern can have only one creature swallowed at a time. If the wyvern takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the wyvern must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the wyvern. If the wyvern dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.
