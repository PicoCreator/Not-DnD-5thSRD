### Actions 
**Multiattack.** The dretch makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.    
**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 3 (1d6) piercing damage.    
**Claws.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (2d4) slashing damage.    
**Fetid Cloud (1/Day).** A 10-foot radius of noxious green gas radiates from the dretch. The gas spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any creature that begins its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and cannot take reactions.
