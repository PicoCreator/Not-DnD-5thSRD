### Actions 
**Enlargement (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, the dwarves magically increase in size, along with anything they are wearing or carrying. While enlarged, the dwarves are Large, double their damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks (included in the attacks), and make Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage. If the dwarves lack the room to become Large, they attain the maximum size possible in the space available.    
**War Pick.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage, or 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage while enlarged.    
**Javelin.** _Melee or _Ranged Weapon Attack:__ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, or 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage while enlarged.    
**Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The dwarves magically turn invisible until they attack, cast a spell, or use their Enlargement, or until their concentration is broken, up to 1 hour (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the dwarves wear or carry is invisible with them.
