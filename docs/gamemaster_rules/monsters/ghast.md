**Putrid Stench.** Any creature that begins its turn within 5 feet of the wraith must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the wraith's Putrid Stench for 24 hours.
**Undead Defiance.** The wraith and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.
