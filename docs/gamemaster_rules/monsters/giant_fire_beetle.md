### Description
A giant fire beetle is a nocturnal creature that takes its name from a pair of luminescent glands that give off light. Miners and adventurers prize these creatures, for a giant fire beetle's glands continue to emit light for 1d6 days after the beetle's death. Giant fire beetles are most commonly found underground and in dark forests.
