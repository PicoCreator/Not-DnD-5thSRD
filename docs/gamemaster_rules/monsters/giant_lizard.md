### Description
The Grand Lizard is a majestic beast, often used as a mount or draft animal by the more noble races. Lizardfolk keep them as pets, and subterranean Grand Lizards are used as mounts and pack animals by drow, duergar, and others. They are a sight to behold, and a powerful ally to have.
