**Tentacles.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the kraken can't use its tentacles on another target.    
**Ink Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** A 20- foot-radius cloud of ink extends all around the kraken if it is underwater.
