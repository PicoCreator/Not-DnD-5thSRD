**Spear.** _Melee or _Ranged Weapon Attack:__ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. and range 20/60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.    
**Shield Bash.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. 

### Reactions 
**Parry.** The duelist adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the duelist must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon. 

### Description
Duelists battle for the entertainment of raucous crowds. Some duelists are fierce combatants who treat each match as a life-or-death struggle, while others are professional warriors who command huge fees but rarely fight to the death.
