**Formless** The Ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
**Corrode Metal** Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that strikes the Ooze corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that strikes the Ooze is destroyed after dealing damage.
The Ooze can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical metal in 1 round.
**False Appearance** While the Ooze remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an oily pool or wet rock.

### Actions
**Pseudopod** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage, and if the target is wearing nonmagical metal armour, its armour is partly corroded and takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armour is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.
