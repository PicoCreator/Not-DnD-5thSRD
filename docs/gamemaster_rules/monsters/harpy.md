**Hit Points** 38 (7d8 + 7)
**Speed** 20 ft., fly 40 ft.

| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA     |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 12 (+1) | 13 (+1) | 12 (+1) | 7 (−2)  | 10 (+0) | 13 (+1) |

**Senses** passive Perception 10
**Languages** Common
**Challenge** 1 (200 XP)

### Actions
**Multiattack.** The Harpy makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its club.
**Claws.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (2d4 + 1) slashing damage.
**Club.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage.
**Luring Song.** The Harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the Harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The Harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the Harpy is incapacitated.
While charmed by the Harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other Harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the Harpy, the target must move on its turn towards the Harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the Harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.
A target that successfully saves is immune to this Harpy's song for the next 24 hours.
