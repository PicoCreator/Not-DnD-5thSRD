**Hold Breath.** The wyrm can hold its breath for 1 hour.
**Multiple Heads.** The wyrm has five heads. Whilst it has more than one head, the wyrm has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious.
Whenever the wyrm takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the wyrm dies.
At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage since its last turn. The wyrm regains 10 hit points for each head regrown in this way.
**Reactive Heads.** For each head the wyrm has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks.
**Wakeful.** Whilst the wyrm sleeps, at least one of its heads is awake.

### Actions
**Multiattack.** The wyrm makes as many bite attacks as it has heads.
**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage.
