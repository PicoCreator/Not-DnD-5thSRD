The Xorn is a formidable creature, with a natural armour that is nigh impenetrable. It is able to traverse through unworked earth and stone with ease, and can hide in rocky terrain with great ease. It can also detect the location of precious metals and stones, such as coins and gems, within 60 feet of it.

In battle, the Xorn is a fearsome foe. It can make three claw attacks and one bite attack in a single turn, and its claws and bite can deal a considerable amount of damage.

Be wary of the Xorn, for it is a powerful creature that should not be taken lightly.
