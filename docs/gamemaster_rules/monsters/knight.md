**Courageous.** The squire has advantage on saving throws against being frightened. 

### Actions 
**Multiattack.** The squire makes two melee attacks.    
**Longsword.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.    
**Light Crossbow.** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +2 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d8) piercing damage.    
**Inspire (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, the squire can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the squire. A creature can benefit from only one Inspire die at a time. This effect ends if the squire is incapacitated. 

### Reactions 
**Deflect.** The squire adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the squire must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon. 

### Description
Squires are warriors who pledge service to rulers, religious orders, and noble causes. A squire's alignment determines the extent to which a pledge is honored. Whether undertaking a quest or patrolling a realm, a squire often travels with an entourage that includes knights and hirelings who are commoners.
