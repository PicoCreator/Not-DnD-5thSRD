**Deathly Explosion.** When the magmin perishes, it explodes in a blaze of fire and magma. All creatures within 10 feet of it must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Flammable objects that are not being worn or carried in that area are set alight.    
**Illuminating Ignition.** As a bonus action, the magmin can set itself ablaze or extinguish its flames. While aflame, the magmin emits bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. 

### Actions    
**Touch.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it is set alight. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 3 (1d6) fire damage at the end of each of its turns.
