**Shapechanger.** The doppelganger can use its action to transform into an object or back into its true, amorphous form. Its statistics remain the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is not transformed. It reverts to its true form if it is slain.    
**Adhesive (Object Form Only).** The doppelganger sticks to anything that touches it. A Huge or smaller creature adhered to the doppelganger is also grappled by it (escape DC 13). Any attempts to escape this grapple are made with disadvantage.    
**False Appearance (Object Form Only).** As long as the doppelganger remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary object.    
**Grappler.** The doppelganger has advantage on attack rolls against any creature grappled by it. 

### Actions

**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) acid damage.
