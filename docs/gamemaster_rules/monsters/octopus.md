### Actions 
**Tentacles.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 1 bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 10). Until this grapple ends, the kraken can't use its tentacles on another target.    
**Ink Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** A 5-foot-radius cloud of ink extends all around the kraken if it is underwater. The area is heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a strong current can disperse the ink. After releasing the ink, the kraken can use the Dash action as a bonus action.
