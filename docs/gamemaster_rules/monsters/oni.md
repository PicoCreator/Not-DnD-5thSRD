At will: **_darkness, invisibility_**    
1/day each: **_charm person, cone of cold, gaseous form, sleep_**    
**Magical Weapons.** The ogre's weapon attacks are magical.    
**Regeneration.** The ogre regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. 

### Actions 
**Multiattack.** The ogre makes two attacks, either with its claws or its glaive.    
**Claw (Ogre Form Only).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage.    
**Glaive.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage, or 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage in Small or Medium form.    
**Change Shape.** The ogre magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium humanoid, into a Large giant, or back into its true form. Other than its size, its statistics are the same in each form. The only equipment that is transformed is its glaive, which shrinks so that it can be wielded in humanoid form. If the ogre dies, it reverts to its true form, and its glaive reverts to its normal size.
