### Description
The quipper is a voracious fish, with a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth. It is able to thrive in any aquatic environment, from the depths of the coldest subterranean lake to the warmest of seas. Quippers often gather in swarms, and the statistics for such a swarm can be found later in this appendix.
