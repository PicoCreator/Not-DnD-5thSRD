### Actions 
**Multiattack.** The Rakshasa makes two claw attacks.    
**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage, and the target is cursed if it is a creature. The magical curse takes effect whenever the target takes a short or long rest, filling the target's thoughts with nightmarish visions and dreams. The cursed target gains no benefit from finishing a short or long rest. The curse lasts until it is lifted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.
