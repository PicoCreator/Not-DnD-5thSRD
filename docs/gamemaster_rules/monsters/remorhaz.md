**Frosty Body.** Any creature that touches the Frost Wyrm or strikes it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) cold damage.

### Actions
**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 40 (6d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the Frost Wyrm can't bite another target.
**Swallow.** The Frost Wyrm makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the Frost Wyrm, and it takes 21 (6d6) cold damage at the start of each of the Frost Wyrm's turns.
If the Frost Wyrm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the Frost Wyrm must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the Frost Wyrm. If the Frost Wyrm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.
