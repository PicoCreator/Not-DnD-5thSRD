**False Appearances.** When the roper remains still, it is indistinguishable from a normal cave formation, such as a stalagmite.    
**Grasping Tentacles.** The roper can have up to six tentacles at a time. Each tentacle can be attacked (AC 20; 10 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage). Destroying a tentacle does not cause damage to the roper, which can extrude a new tentacle on its next turn. A tentacle can also be broken if a creature takes an action and succeeds on a DC 15 Strength check against it.    
**Spider Climb.** The roper can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. 

### Actions 
**Multiattack.** The roper makes four attacks with its tentacles, uses Reel, and makes one attack with its bite.    
**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 22 (4d8 + 4) piercing damage.    
**Tentacle.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 50 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ The target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and the roper can't use the same tentacle on another target.    
**Reel.** The roper pulls each creature grappled by it up to 25 feet straight towards it.
