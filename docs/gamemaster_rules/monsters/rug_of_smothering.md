**Antimagic Susceptibility.** The Dreaded Smothering Carpet is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by **_dispel magic_**, the carpet must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.

**Damage Transfer.** While it is grappling a creature, the carpet takes only half the damage dealt to it, and the creature grappled by the carpet takes the other half.

**False Appearance.** While the carpet remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal rug.

### Actions 
**Smother.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. _Hit:_ The creature is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, blinded, and at risk of suffocating, and the carpet can't smother another target. In addition, at the start of each of the target's turns, the target takes 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
