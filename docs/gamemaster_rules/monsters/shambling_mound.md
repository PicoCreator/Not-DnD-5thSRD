### Actions 
**Multiattack.** The ancient mound makes two slam attacks. If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is grappled (escape DC 14), and the ancient mound uses its Engulf on it.    
**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.    
**Engulf.** The ancient mound engulfs a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed target is blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the mound's turns or suffer 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the mound moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The mound can have only one creature engulfed at a time.
