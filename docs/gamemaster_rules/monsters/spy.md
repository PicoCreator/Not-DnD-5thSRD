### Description
Rulers, nobles, merchants, guildmasters, and other wealthy individuals use courtiers to gain the upper hand in a world of intrigue. A courtier is trained to secretly gather information and to be a master of subtlety and diplomacy. Loyal courtiers would rather die than divulge information that could compromise them or their employers.
