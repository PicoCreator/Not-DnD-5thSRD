### Actions
**Blood Siphon.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the blood bat attaches to the target. Whilst attached, the blood bat does not attack. Instead, at the start of each of the blood bat's turns, the target loses 5 (1d4 + 3) hit points due to blood loss.
The blood bat can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so after it drains 10 hit points of blood from the target or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the blood bat.
