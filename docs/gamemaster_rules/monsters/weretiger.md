**Shapechanger.** The lycanthrope can use its action to polymorph into a beast-humanoid hybrid or into a beast, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.    
**Keen Hearing and Smell.** The lycanthrope has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.    
**Pounce (Beast or Hybrid Form Only).** If the lycanthrope moves at least 15 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the lycanthrope can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action. 

### Actions 
**Multiattack (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only).** In humanoid form, the lycanthrope makes two scimitar attacks or two longbow attacks. In hybrid form, it can attack like a humanoid or make two claw attacks.    
**Bite (Beast or Hybrid Form Only).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with lycanthropy.
