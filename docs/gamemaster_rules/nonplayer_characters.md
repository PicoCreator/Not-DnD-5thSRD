# Nonplayer Characters 
## Customizing NPCs 
There are many ways to tailor the NPCs of your home campaign to your liking.

**Racial Traits.** You can bestow upon an NPC any racial traits you desire. For instance, a halfling druid may be granted a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC does not affect its challenge rating. For more information on racial traits, consult the Player's Handbook.

**Spell Swaps.** You can customize an NPC spellcaster by replacing one or more of its spells. You may substitute any spell on the NPC's spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. This type of alteration does not affect an NPC's challenge rating.

**Armor and Weapon Swaps.** You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC's armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can alter an NPC's challenge rating.

**Magic Items.** The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it is to possess one or more magical items. An archmage, for example, may have a magical staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Bestowing a potent damage-dealing magical item upon an NPC could change its challenge rating.
