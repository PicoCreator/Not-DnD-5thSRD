## Customizing Avatars

There are many ways to customize the avatars for your home campaign.

**Racial Qualities.** You can add racial qualities to an avatar. For example, a halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Fortunate trait. Adding racial qualities to an avatar does not alter its challenge rating. For more on racial qualities, see the Player's Handbook.

**Spell Substitutions.** One way to customize an avatar spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the avatar's spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping spells in this manner does not alter an avatar's challenge rating.

**Armor and Weapon Changes.** You can upgrade or downgrade an avatar's armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an avatar's challenge rating.

**Magical Items.** The more powerful an avatar, the more likely it has one or more magical items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a magical staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an avatar a potent damage-dealing magical item could alter its challenge rating.
