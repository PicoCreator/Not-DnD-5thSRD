In this fantastical realm, the rules and regulations concerning the use of poisons are as follows:

Poisons are a dangerous and insidious force, capable of wreaking havoc upon the unsuspecting. As such, they must be handled with the utmost care and caution. Those who would use them must be aware of the potential consequences of their actions, and must take all necessary precautions to ensure that no harm comes to themselves or others.

The use of poisons is strictly forbidden in all forms of combat, and any attempt to do so will be met with swift and severe punishment. Furthermore, any attempt to create or distribute poisons without the express permission of the governing authority is strictly prohibited.

Those who are found to be in possession of poisons without the proper authorization will be subject to the full extent of the law.

It is the responsibility of all citizens to be aware of the dangers posed by poisons, and to take all necessary steps to ensure that they are not used in any way that could cause harm.

# Poisons
In many realms, the use of poisons is considered a heinous act, and is thus outlawed. Yet, they remain a favorite tool of assassins, drow, and other nefarious creatures.

Poisons come in four distinct varieties:

**Contact.** Contact poisons can be smeared on an object, and will remain potent until it is touched or washed away. Any creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin will suffer its effects.

**Ingested.** Ingested poisons must be swallowed in their entirety in order to take effect. This can be done through food or liquid. It is possible that a partial dose may have a reduced effect, such as granting advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.

**Inhaled.** Inhaled poisons come in the form of powders or gases, and take effect when breathed in. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas will subject any creature in a 5-foot cube to its effects. The resulting cloud will dissipate immediately afterwards. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.

**Injury.** Injury poisons can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage, and will remain potent until delivered through a wound or washed away. Any creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison will be exposed to its effects.

## Potent Potions
Each type of potion has its own unique and powerful effects.

**Assassin's Elixir (Ingested).** A creature that partakes of this potion must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6 (1d12) poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't poisoned.

**Burnt Othur Fumes (Inhaled).** A creature that breathes in this potion must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On each successive failed save, the character takes 3 (1d6) poison damage. After three successful saves, the potion ends.

**Crawler Mucus (Contact).** This potion must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated crawler. A creature that comes into contact with this potion must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Drow Poison (Injury).** This potion is typically made only by the drow, and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature that is injured by this potion must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to rouse it.

**Essence of Ether (Inhaled).** A creature that inhales this potion must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 8 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to awaken it.

**Malice (Inhaled).** A creature that breathes in this potion must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature is blinded.

**Midnight Tears (Ingested).** A creature that consumes this potion suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the potion has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Oil of Taggit (Contact).** A creature that comes into contact with this potion must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 24 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage.

**Pale Tincture (Ingested).** A creature that ingests this potion must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and become poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failed save. Until this potion ends, the damage the potion deals can't be healed by any means. After seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the creature can heal normally.

**Purple Worm Poison (Injury).** This potion must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated purple worm. A creature that is injured by this potion must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Serpent Venom (Injury).** This potion must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated giant poisonous snake. A creature that is injured by this potion must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Truth Serum (Ingested).** A creature that ingests this potion must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature can't knowingly speak a lie, as if under the effect of a zone of truth spell.

**Wyvern Poison (Injury).** This potion must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated wyvern. A creature that is injured by this potion must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
