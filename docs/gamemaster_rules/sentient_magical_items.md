# Sentient Magic Items 
Some magical objects possess sentience and character. Such an item may be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a former owner, or self-aware due to the enchantment used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, with its own peculiarities, ideals, connections, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item may be a beloved companion to its wielder or a constant source of trouble.

Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can also become sentient, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.

Sentient magic items act as NPCs under the control of the GM. Any activated property of the item is under the control of the item, not its wielder. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even use them against the wielder.

## Crafting Sentient Magic Items 
When you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item's persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here.

### Abilities 
A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can choose the item's abilities or determine them randomly. To determine them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, discarding the lowest roll and adding up the rest.
### Speech
A sentient item has some capacity to converse, either by expressing its feelings, broadcasting its contemplations telepathically, or talking out loud. You can pick how it talks or roll on the accompanying table. 

| d100  | Communication |
|-------|---------------|
| 01-60 | The item communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature bearing or wielding it. |
| 61-90 | The item can talk, read, and comprehend one or more dialects. |
| 91-00 |  The item can talk, read, and comprehend one or more dialects. Moreover, the item can communicate telepathically with any character that bears or wields it. |


### Perceptions 
With sentience comes mindfulness. A sentient item can detect its environment out to a restricted range. You can pick its faculties or roll on the accompanying table. 

| d4 | Senses                                     |
|----|--------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Hearing and typical vision out to 30 feet.  |
| 2  | Hearing and typical vision out to 60 feet.  |
| 3  | Hearing and typical vision out to 120 feet. |
| 4  | Hearing and darksight out to 120 feet.    |
### Alignment 
A magical item with sentience has an alignment, which may be suggested by its creator or nature. If not, the alignment can be chosen or determined by rolling on the following table. 

| d100  | Alignment       |
|-------|-----------------|
| 01-15 | Lawful Good     |
| 16-35 | Neutral Good    |
| 36-50 | Chaotic Good    |
| 51-63 | Lawful Neutral  |
| 64-73 | Neutral         |
| 74-85 | Chaotic Neutral |
| 86-89 | Lawful Evil     |
| 90-96 | Neutral Evil    |
| 97-00 | Chaotic Evil    |

### Special Purpose 
A sentient item can be given an objective to pursue, which may take precedence over all else. As long as the wielder's use of the item is in line with this special purpose, the item will remain cooperative. If the wielder deviates from this course, it may cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and the item may even prevent the use of its activated properties. The special purpose can be chosen or determined by rolling on the following table. 

| d10 | Purpose                                                                                                                                |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Aligned: The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a diametrically opposed alignment. (Such an item is never neutral.)              |
| 2   | Bane: The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures of a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, trolls, or wizards.           |
| 3   | Protector: The item seeks to defend a particular race or kind of creature, such as elves or druids.                                    |
| 4   | Crusader: The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or destroy the servants of a particular deity.                                             |
| 5   | Templar: The item seeks to defend the servants and interests of a particular deity.                                                    |
| 6   | Destroyer: The item craves destruction and goads its user to fight arbitrarily.                                                        |
| 7   | Glory Seeker: The item seeks renown as the greatest magic item in the world, by establishing its user as a famous or notorious figure. |
| 8   | Lore Seeker: The item craves knowledge or is determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or unravel a cryptic prophecy.             |
| 9   | Destiny Seeker: The item is convinced that it and its wielder have key roles to play in future events.                                 |
| 10  | Creator Seeker: The item seeks its creator and wants to understand why it was created.                                                 |

### Conflict 
A sentient item has its own will, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner contrary to the item's alignment or purpose, conflict may arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder's Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it may make one or more of the following demands:

* The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.
* The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.
* The item demands that its wielder pursue the item's goals to the exclusion of all other goals.
* The item demands to be given to someone else. 

If its wielder refuses to comply with the item's wishes, the item can do any or all of the following:
* Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.
* Suppress one or more of its activated properties. 
* Attempt to take control of its wielder.

If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item's Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item's commands. If the wielder takes damage, they can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item cannot use this power again until the next morn.
