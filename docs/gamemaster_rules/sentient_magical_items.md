# Rules for Creating Sentient Magic Items
Some magical items possess a sentience and personality of their own, be it due to the spirit of a previous owner, or the powerful magicks used to create them. Such items can be a boon to their wielder, or a bane, depending on the relationship between the two. 

Most sentient items are weapons, though other kinds of items can manifest sentience. Consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient. 

Sentient magic items act as NPCs under the control of the Game Master. Any activated properties of the item are under the control of the item, not its wielder. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, they can access its properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties, or even turn them against the wielder. 

## Crafting Sentient Magic Items
When crafting a sentient magic item, the creator must create the item's persona in the same way they would create an NPC, with a few exceptions. 

### Abilities 
A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The creator can choose these scores, or determine them randomly by rolling 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest. 

### Communication 
A sentient item is blessed with the ability to communicate, be it through the sharing of its emotions, the broadcasting of its thoughts through telepathy, or the speaking of words aloud. The manner in which it communicates can be chosen or determined by a roll of the dice. 

| d100  | Communication |
|-------|---------------|
| 01-60 | The item conveys its feelings to the creature that carries or wields it. |
| 61-90 | The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages. |
| 91-00 |  The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages. In addition, the item can communicate telepathically with any character that carries or wields it. |

### Senses 
Sentience brings with it a heightened awareness. A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. The range of its senses can be chosen or determined by a roll of the dice. 

| d4 | Senses                                     |
|----|--------------------------------------------|
| 1  | It can hear and see clearly out to 30 feet.  |
| 2  | It can hear and see clearly out to 60 feet.  |
| 3  | It can hear and see clearly out to 120 feet. |
| 4  | It can hear and see in the dark out to 120 feet.    |

### Alignment 
A magical item of sentience is imbued with an alignment, either by its creator or by its very nature. If not, the wielder may choose an alignment or roll on the following table to determine it. 

| d100  | Alignment       |
|-------|-----------------|
| 01-15 | Lawful good     |
| 16-35 | Neutral good    |
| 36-50 | Chaotic good    |
| 51-63 | Lawful neutral  |
| 64-73 | Neutral         |
| 74-85 | Chaotic neutral |
| 86-89 | Lawful evil     |
| 90-96 | Neutral evil    |
| 97-00 | Chaotic evil    |

### Special Purpose 
The wielder of a sentient item may assign it an objective to pursue, which it may do to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder's use of the item is in line with its special purpose, the item will remain cooperative. Should the wielder deviate from this course, it may cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and the item may even prevent the use of its activated properties. The wielder may choose a special purpose or roll on the following table. 

| d10 | Purpose                                                                                                                                |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Aligned: The item seeks to vanquish or destroy those of a diametrically opposed alignment. (Such an item is never neutral.)              |
| 2   | Bane: The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures of a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, trolls, or wizards.           |
| 3   | Protector: The item seeks to defend a particular race or kind of creature, such as elves or druids.                                    |
| 4   | Crusader: The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or destroy the servants of a particular deity.                                             |
| 5   | Templar: The item seeks to defend the servants and interests of a particular deity.                                                    |
| 6   | Destroyer: The item hungers for destruction and goads its user to fight arbitrarily.                                                        |
| 7   | Glory Seeker: The item seeks renown as the greatest magic item in the world, by establishing its user as a famous or notorious figure. |
| 8   | Lore Seeker: The item hungers for knowledge or is determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or unravel a cryptic prophecy.             |
| 9   | Destiny Seeker: The item is convinced that it and its wielder have key roles to play in future events.                                 |
| 10  | Creator Seeker: The item seeks its creator and wants to understand why it was created.                                                 |

### Conflict 
A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item's alignment or purpose, conflict may arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder's Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it may make one or more of the following demands:

* The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.
* The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.
* The item demands that its wielder pursue the item's goals to the exclusion of all other goals.
* The item demands to be given to someone else. 

Should its wielder refuse to comply with the item's wishes, the item may do any or all of the following:
* Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.
* Suppress one or more of its activated properties. 
* Attempt to take control of its wielder.

If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item's Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item's commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item cannot use this power again until the next dawn.
