# Traps and Their Perils

Traps can be found in many places, from the depths of ancient tombs to the trees of a forest. One misstep in a tomb may set off a series of scything blades, which can cut through armor and flesh alike. Vines hanging from a cave entrance may grasp and choke any who pass through them. A net hidden among the trees may drop on unsuspecting travelers. In a fantasy game, adventurers may find themselves falling to their deaths, burned alive, or pierced by poisoned darts.

A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature. **Mechanical traps** include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, and whirling blades, all of which rely on a mechanism to operate. **Magic traps** are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated, while spell traps are spells such as **_glyph of warding_** and **_symbol_** that act as traps.

## Traps in Play
When adventurers come across a trap, it is important to know how it is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility of detecting and disabling or avoiding it.

### Setting Off a Trap
Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap's creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the **_glyph of warding_** spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.
### Uncovering and Disabling a Trap
In most cases, a trap's design is such that it can be seen with careful inspection. Characters may spot an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, the glint of a trip wire, small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will burst forth, or any other sign that points to a trap's presence.

The description of a trap will specify the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively searching for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap's DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character's passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they may be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves' tools to perform the necessary sabotage.

Any character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disable a magical trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap's description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition, **_dispel magic_** has a chance of disabling most magical traps. A magical trap's description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use **_dispel magic_**.

In most cases, a trap's description is clear enough that you can decide whether a character's actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you should not allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap's description to determine what happens. No trap's design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.

You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap's presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.

Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it's trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.

Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap. 

### Trap Effects
The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to lethal, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap's description specifies what happens when it is triggered.

The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap's severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.

A trap intended to be a **setback** is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a **dangerous** trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels. A **deadly** trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels. 

#### Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses
| Trap Danger | Save DC | Attack Bonus |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| Setback     | 10-11   | +3 to +5     |
| Dangerous   | 12-15   | +6 to +8     |
| Deadly      | 16-20   | +9 to +12    |

#### Damage Severity by Level
| Character Level | Setback | Dangerous | Deadly |
|-----------------|---------|-----------|--------|
| 1st-4th         | 1d10    | 2d10      | 4d10   |
| 5th-10th        | 2d10    | 4d10      | 10d10  |
| 11th-16th       | 4d10    | 10d10     | 18d10  |
| 17th-20th       | 10d10   | 18d10     | 24d10  |


### Complex Traps 
Complex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.

When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap's description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.

For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap's turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded.
## Sample Traps 
The magical and mechanical snares presented here differ in their deadliness and are listed in alphabetical order. 

### Collapsing Ceiling 
_Mechanical trap_ 

This trap uses a trip wire to bring down the supports keeping an unsteady section of a roof in place.

The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disables the trip wire without harm. A character without thieves' tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.

Anyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap to trigger.

The ceiling above the trip wire is in poor condition, and anyone who can see it can tell that it is in danger of collapse.

When the trap is triggered, the unsteady ceiling falls. Any creature in the area beneath the unsteady section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain. 

### Falling Net 
_Mechanical trap_ 

This trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.

The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools breaks the trip wire without harm. A character without thieves' tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.

When the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section. 

### Fire-Spewing Statue 
_Magic trap_ 

This trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell.

The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as **_detect magic_**, reveals an aura of evocation magic around the statue.

The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A successful **_dispel magic_** (DC 13) cast on the statue destroys the trap.
### Snares 
_Mechanical entrapment_ 

Four primary snares are presented here.

**Simple Snare.** A simple snare is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the snare's edge and concealed with dirt and debris.

The DC to detect the snare is 10. Anybody stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the snare, taking harm contingent upon the snare's profundity (ordinarily 10 feet, however some snares are more profound).

**Concealed Snare.** This snare has a cover made of material indistinguishable from the floor around it.

A fruitful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check recognizes an absence of foot traffic over the segment of floor that structures the snare's cover. A fruitful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is important to affirm that the snared segment of floor is really the cover of a snare.

At the point when a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the interloper to spill into the snare beneath. The snare is typically 10 or 20 feet profound yet can be more profound.

Once the snare trap is identified, an iron spike or comparable article can be wedged between the snare's cover and the encompassing floor in such a way, to the point that it forestalls the cover from opening, along these lines making it sheltered to cross. The cover can likewise be mystically held shut utilizing the **_arcane lock_** spell or comparable enchantment.

**Locking Snare.** This snare trap is indistinguishable from a concealed snare trap, with one key exemption: the trap entryway that covers the snare is spring-stacked. After a creature falls into the snare, the cover snaps shut to trap its casualty inside.

A fruitful DC 20 Strength check is important to pry the cover open. The cover can likewise be crushed open. A character in the snare can likewise endeavor to incapacitate the spring instrument from within with a DC 15 Dexterity check utilizing thieves' devices, gave that the instrument can be come to and the character can see. In certain cases, a system (ordinarily covered up behind a mystery entryway close by) opens the snare.

**Spiked Snare.** This snare trap is a basic, concealed, or locking snare trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the base. A creature falling into the snare takes 11 (2d10) penetrating harm from the spikes, notwithstanding any falling harm. Much nastier forms have toxin smeared on the spikes. In that case, anybody taking penetrating harm from the spikes must likewise make a DC 13 Constitution sparing toss, taking an 22 (4d10) toxin harm on a fizzled spare, or half as much harm on a fruitful one. 

### Poison Bolts 
_Mechanical trap_ 

At the point when a creature steps on a covered weight plate, poison-tipped bolts shoot from spring-stacked or pressurized tubes shrewdly inserted in the encompassing dividers. A region may incorporate different weight plates, each one rigged to its own arrangement of bolts.

The little gaps in the dividers are obscured by residue and cobwebs, or shrewdly covered up among bas-reliefs, wall paintings, or frescoes that enrich the dividers. The DC to spot them is 15. With a fruitful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the nearness of the weight plate from varieties in the mortar and stone utilized to make it, contrasted with the encompassing floor. Wedging an iron spike or other article under the weight plate forestalls the trap from initiating. Stuffing the gaps with material or wax forestalls the bolts contained inside from dispatching.

The trap initiates when in excess of 20 pounds of weight is set on the weight plate, discharging four bolts. Each bolt makes a ranged assault with a +8 reward against a haphazard objective inside 10 feet of the weight plate (vision is unimportant to this assault move). (On the off chance that there are no objectives in the region, the bolts don't hit anything.) An objective that is hit takes 2 (1d4) penetrating harm and must prevail on a DC 15 Constitution sparing toss, taking 11 (2d10) toxin harm on a fizzled spare, or half as much harm on a fruitful one.
### The Poisoned Needle
_Mechanical Trap_

A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest's lock, or in something else that a creature might open. If the chest is opened without the proper key, the needle springs out, delivering a dose of poison.

When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches from the lock. Any creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.

A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to detect the alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools can disarm the trap, removing the needle from the lock. If the lock is unsuccessfully picked, the trap is triggered. 

### The Rolling Sphere
_Mechanical Trap_

When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap's pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.

A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate's presence. The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. An iron spike or other object wedged under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.

When the trap is triggered, all creatures present must roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures' spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature's space or a creature enters its space while it's rolling, that creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.

The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It cannot go around corners, but clever dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.

As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere's speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere's speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat. 

### The Sphere of Annihilation
_Magical Trap_

A magical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated.

A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth contains a **_sphere of annihilation_** that cannot be controlled or moved. It is otherwise identical to a normal **_sphere of annihilation_**.

Some versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is similar to the **_sympathy_** aspect of the **_antipathy/sympathy_** spell. A successful **_dispel magic_** (DC 18) removes this enchantment.
