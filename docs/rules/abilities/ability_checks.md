Description: Rules for making ability checks, contents, group and passive checks from the 5th Edition (5e) System Reference Document (SRD)

# Ability Checks 
A character or monster's natural talent and training is tested when attempting to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

The GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.

#### Typical Difficulty Classes
| Task Difficulty   | DC |
|-------------------|----| 
| Very easy         | 5  |
| Easy              | 10 |
| Medium            | 15 |
| Hard              | 20 |
| Very hard         | 25 |
| Nearly impossible | 30 |

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. Bonuses and penalties are applied, and the total is compared to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success--the creature overcomes the challenge. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.

## Contests 
When two characters or monsters are attempting the same task, or one is trying to prevent the other from succeeding, a contest is held. Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, and compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest.

## Skills 
Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's skill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.)

For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.

The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability's description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability. 

### Strength 
* Athletics 

### Dexterity 
* Acrobatics
* Sleight of Hand 
* Stealth

Thank you for the rewrite. It looks great!

### Charm

* Intimidation
* Performance
* Persuasion

At times, the Game Master may ask for a test of ability using a certain skill - for example, "Make a Wisdom (Perception) check". At other times, a player may ask the GM if they have proficiency in a certain skill that applies to a check. In either case, having proficiency in a skill means one can add their proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, one makes a normal ability check.

For example, if a character attempts to climb a perilous cliff, the GM may ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, their proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks proficiency, they simply make a Strength check.

### Variant: Skills with Different Abilities
Generally, one's proficiency in a skill only applies to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for instance, usually applies to Strength checks. In some cases, however, one's proficiency may reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM may ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or one may ask the GM if they can apply their proficiency to a different check. For example, if one must swim from an offshore island to the mainland, the GM may call for a Constitution check to see if they have the stamina to make it. In this case, the GM may allow one to apply their proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. Therefore, if one is proficient in Athletics, they apply their proficiency bonus to the Constitution check as they would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when a half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, the GM may ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is usually associated with Charisma.

## Passive Checks
A passive check is a special kind of ability check that does not involve any dice rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.

To determine a character's total for a passive check: 

> 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check

 If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a **score**.

For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, they have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.

The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules. 

## Working Together
At times two or more characters may join forces to attempt a task. The character who is leading the effort - or the one with the highest ability modifier - can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.

A character can only provide help if the task is one that they could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves' tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency cannot help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help. 

### Group Checks
When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM may ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who are not.

To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.

Otherwise, the group fails. Group checks do not come up often, and they are most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM may call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.
