In this realm, the test of one's mettle is oft determined by the roll of a die. When a character or creature attempts an action that may result in failure, an Ability Check is called for. The Game Master shall decide which of the six abilities is most pertinent to the task at hand, and assign a Difficulty Class to the challenge. The higher the Difficulty Class, the more difficult the task.

To make an Ability Check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. Bonuses and penalties should be applied, and the total should be compared to the Difficulty Class. If the total is equal to or greater than the Difficulty Class, the Ability Check is a success and the character or creature has overcome the challenge. Otherwise, it is a failure and the character or creature makes no progress or suffers a setback as determined by the Game Master.

In some cases, two characters or creatures may be in direct opposition to one another. This is known as a Contest, and both participants must make an Ability Check appropriate to their efforts. The participant with the higher check total wins the Contest and either succeeds or prevents the other from succeeding. In the event of a tie, the situation remains as it was before the Contest.

Each Ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including Skills that a character or creature may be proficient in. A Skill represents a specific aspect of an Ability Score, and proficiency in a Skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. The Skills related to each Ability Score are listed below:

### Strength 
* Athletics 

### Dexterity 
* Acrobatics
* Sleight of Hand 
* Stealth 

### Intelligence
* Arcana
* History
* Investigation
* Nature
* Religion 

In this world, those of great intellect are able to draw upon their knowledge of the arcane, the past, the secrets of the world, the natural world, and the divine.

### Wisdom
* Animal Handling
* Insight
* Medicine
* Perception
* Survival 

Those of great wisdom are able to understand the ways of animals, to see the truth of a situation, to tend to the sick, to perceive the world around them, and to survive in the wild.

### Charisma 
* Deception
* Intimidation
* Performance
* Persuasion 

Those of great charisma are able to deceive, to intimidate, to perform, and to persuade.

Sometimes, the Game Master may ask for an ability check using a specific skill--for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player may ask the Game Master if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.

For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the Game Master might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check. 

### Variant: Skills with Different Abilities 
Normally, one's proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, one's proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the Game Master might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or one might ask the Game Master if they can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if one must swim from an offshore island to the mainland, the Game Master might call for a Constitution check to see if they have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, the Game Master might allow one to apply their proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if one is proficient in Athletics, they apply their proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as they would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when a half-­‐‑orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, the Game Master might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma. 

## Passive Checks 
A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the Game Master wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.

Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check: 

> 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check

 If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a **score**.

For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.

The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules. 

## Working Together 
Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort--or the one with the highest ability modifier--can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the aid provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.

A character can only provide aid if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves' tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help. 

### Group Checks 
When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the Game Master might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.

To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.

Otherwise, the group fails. Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the Game Master might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.
