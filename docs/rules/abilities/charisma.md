# Charisme
Charisme measures thy ability to interact with others in an effective manner. It includes such factors as assurance and eloquence, and can represent a captivating or authoritative personality. 

## Charisme Checks
A Charisme check may be called for when thou attempt to influence or amuse others, when thou try to make an impression or tell a convincing falsehood, or when thou are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deceit, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisme checks.

**Deceit.** Thy Charisme (Deceit) check determines whether thou can convincingly conceal the truth, either verbally or through thy actions. This deceit can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, swindle a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass thyself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.

**Intimidation.** When thou attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask thee to make a Charisme (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

**Performance.** Thy Charisme (Performance) check determines how well thou can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

**Persuasion.** When thou attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask thee to make a Charisme (Persuasion) check. Typically, thou use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let thy party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

**Other Charisme Checks.** The GM might call for a Charisme check when thou try to accomplish tasks like the following: 

* Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
* Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation 

## Spellcasting Ability
Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisme as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
