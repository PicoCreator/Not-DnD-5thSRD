# Charisma
Charisma is a measure of one's ability to interact with others in a meaningful and effective manner. It encompasses such qualities as confidence, eloquence, and charm, and can be used to represent a captivating or commanding presence.

## Charisma Checks
A Charisma check may be called for when attempting to influence or entertain others, make a lasting impression, or navigate a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills are all reflective of aptitude in certain Charisma checks.

**Deception.** A Charisma (Deception) check is used to determine one's ability to successfully conceal the truth, either through words or actions. This can range from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Examples of this include trying to deceive a guard, swindling a merchant, gambling for money, disguising oneself, allaying suspicions with false assurances, or maintaining a straight face while telling a blatant falsehood.

**Intimidation.** When attempting to influence someone through threats, hostile actions, or physical violence, a Charisma (Intimidation) check may be called for. Examples of this include trying to extract information from a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using a broken bottle to persuade a haughty vizier to reconsider a decision.

**Performance.** A Charisma (Performance) check is used to determine one's ability to captivate an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

**Persuasion.** When attempting to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, a Charisma (Persuasion) check may be called for. This is typically used when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of this include convincing a chamberlain to allow one's party to see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

**Other Charisma Checks.** A Charisma check may be called for when attempting to accomplish tasks such as finding the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip, or blending into a crowd to get a sense of key topics of conversation.

## Spellcasting Ability
Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks all use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
