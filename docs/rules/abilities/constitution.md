# Constitution 
Constitution is a measure of one's health, vigor, and vital force.

## Constitution Checks 
Constitution checks are not common, and no skills are associated with them, as the endurance this ability represents is more passive than active. However, a Constitution check may be called for when a character or monster attempts to push beyond their normal limits.

The GM may call for a Constitution check when a character attempts any of the following:

* Holding their breath
* Working or marching for hours without rest
* Going without sleep
* Surviving without food or water
* Drinking an entire stein of ale in one go

## Hit Points 
The Constitution modifier contributes to one's hit points. Generally, the Constitution modifier is added to each Hit Die rolled for hit points.

If the Constitution modifier changes, the hit point maximum changes as well, as if the modifier had always been the new value. For example, if the Constitution score is increased when reaching 4th level and the modifier increases from +1 to +2, the hit point maximum is adjusted as if the modifier had always been +2. This means 3 hit points are added for the first three levels, and then the hit points for 4th level are rolled using the new modifier. Alternatively, if some effect lowers the Constitution score and reduces the modifier by 1 at 7th level, the hit point maximum is reduced by 7.
