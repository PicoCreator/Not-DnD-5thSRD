Dexterity is a measure of agility, reflexes, and balance. It is used to determine a character's ability to move quickly and quietly, as well as to keep their footing in tricky situations. Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth are all skills that rely on Dexterity checks.

When attempting to stay on one's feet in a difficult situation, such as running across a sheet of ice or balancing on a tightrope, a Dexterity check is necessary. Additionally, Dexterity checks are used to perform acrobatic stunts, such as dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

Sleight of Hand checks are used when attempting acts of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on one's person. Stealth checks are used when attempting to hide from enemies, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

Other Dexterity checks may be called for when attempting to control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent, steer a chariot around a tight turn, pick a lock, disable a trap, securely tie up a prisoner, wriggle free of bonds, play a stringed instrument, or craft a small or detailed object.

When attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow, or a melee weapon with the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier, one's Dexterity modifier is added to both the attack roll and the damage roll. Depending on the armor worn, some or all of one's Dexterity modifier may be added to their Armor Class.

At the beginning of every combat, a Dexterity check is used to determine initiative, which determines the order of creatures' turns in combat.

When attempting to hide, a Dexterity (Stealth) check is made. This check is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of one's presence. It is impossible to hide from a creature that can see one clearly, and making noise will give away one's position. In combat, most creatures are alert for signs of danger, so if one comes out of hiding and approaches a creature, it usually sees them. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow one to stay hidden as they approach a creature that is distracted, allowing them to gain advantage on an attack roll before they are seen.

When attempting to hide, the DM compares one's Dexterity (Stealth) check with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of any creature that might notice them. This score is equal to 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.

The amount of light in an area is a major factor in determining whether one can find a hidden creature or object. Areas can be lightly or heavily obscured.
