# Intellect
Intellect measures mental sharpness, accuracy of memory, and the capacity to reason. 

## Intellect Tests
An Intellect test is called for when you must draw on logic, learning, recollection, or deduction. The Arcana, History, Exploration, Nature, and Religion aptitudes reflect skill in certain kinds of Intellect tests.

**Arcana.** Your Intellect (Arcana) test measures your capacity to remember lore about spells, magical items, eldritch symbols, magical customs, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.

**History.** Your Intellect (History) test measures your capacity to remember lore about past events, legendary people, ancient realms, past quarrels, recent wars, and lost civilizations.

**Exploration.** When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intellect (Exploration) test. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon caused it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Examining ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intellect (Exploration) test.

**Nature.** Your Intellect (Nature) test measures your capacity to remember lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.

**Religion.** Your Intellect (Religion) test measures your capacity to remember lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.

**Other Intellect Tests.** The GM might call for an Intellect test when you attempt to accomplish tasks such as the following: 

* Converse with a creature without using words
* Estimate the worth of a valuable item
* Put together a disguise to pass as a city guard
* Forge a document
* Recall lore about a craft or trade
* Triumph in a game of skill

## Spellcasting Ability 
Wizards use Intellect as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
