# Intelligence 
Intelligence is a measure of one's mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the capacity for reasoned thought. 

## Intelligence Checks 
When one needs to draw upon logic, education, memory, or deduction, an Intelligence check is called for. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills are all reflective of aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.

**Arcana.** An Intelligence (Arcana) check is used to measure one's ability to recall lore about spells, magical items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.

**History.** An Intelligence (History) check is used to measure one's ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.

**Investigation.** When one looks around for clues and makes deductions based on those clues, an Intelligence (Investigation) check is called for. One might be able to deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

**Nature.** An Intelligence (Nature) check is used to measure one's ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.

**Religion.** An Intelligence (Religion) check is used to measure one's ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.

**Other Intelligence Checks.** The GM might call for an Intelligence check when one attempts tasks such as the following: 

* Communicating with a creature without using words
* Estimating the value of a precious item
* Putting together a disguise to pass as a city guard
* Forging a document
* Recalling lore about a craft or trade
* Winning a game of skill

## Spellcasting Ability 
Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
