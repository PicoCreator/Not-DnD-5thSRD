# Saving Throws
Saving throws represent a valiant effort to resist the perils of magic, traps, poisons, diseases, and other such threats. Characters and monsters alike are often forced to make a saving throw when they are in danger of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. For instance, a Dexterity saving throw would require the addition of the character's Dexterity modifier.

The GM may choose to modify a saving throw with situational bonuses or penalties, or with advantage or disadvantage.

Each class grants proficiency in at least two saving throws. For example, wizards are proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw allows a character to add their proficiency bonus to the saving throw made with the relevant ability score. Some monsters also have saving throw proficiencies.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For instance, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster's spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also determined by the effect that allows the save. Generally, a successful save means that a creature is spared from harm, or at least suffers reduced harm.
