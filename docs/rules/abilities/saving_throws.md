# Saving Throws
A saving throw, also known as a save, is an attempt to resist a spell, trap, poison, disease, or similar danger. Characters and monsters are often forced to make a saving throw when they are at risk of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, a Dexterity saving throw would use the character's Dexterity modifier.

Situational bonuses or penalties, as well as advantage and disadvantage, can modify a saving throw.

Each class grants proficiency in at least two saving throws. For example, wizards are proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw allows a character to add their proficiency bonus to the saving throw made with the corresponding ability score. Some monsters also have saving throw proficiencies.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster's spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also determined by the effect that allows the save. Generally, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.
