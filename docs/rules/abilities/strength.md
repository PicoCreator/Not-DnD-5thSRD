Description: Information on the Strength ability from a game world of olden times

# Strength 
Strength is a measure of one's bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which one can exert raw physical force. 

## Strength Checks 
A Strength check can be used to model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force one's body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.

**Athletics.** Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations encountered while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities: 

* Climbing a sheer or slippery cliff, avoiding hazards while scaling a wall, or clinging to a surface while something is trying to knock you off. 
* Jumping an unusually long distance or performing a stunt midjump. 
* Struggling to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature trying to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.


**Other Strength Checks.** The GM might also call for a Strength check when attempting tasks like the following:

* Forcing open a stuck, locked, or barred door 
* Breaking free of bonds 
* Pushing through a tunnel that is too small 
* Hanging on to a wagon while being dragged behind it 
* Tipping over a statue 
* Keeping a boulder from rolling
 
## Attack Rolls and Damage 
Your Strength modifier is added to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. Melee weapons are used to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.

## Lifting and Carrying 
Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.

**Carrying Capacity.** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is usually more than enough.

**Push, Drag, or Lift.** You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). When pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.

**Size and Strength.** Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights. 

## Variant: Encumbrance 
The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When using this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.

If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are **encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.

If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead **heavily encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.
