# Wisdom 
Wisdom is a measure of one's attunement to the world around them, and is a reflection of their perceptiveness and intuition. 

## Wisdom Checks
When attempting to read body language, understand another's feelings, take note of the environment, or tend to an injured person, a Wisdom check may be called for. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills are all related to certain kinds of Wisdom checks.

**Animal Handling.** When attempting to calm a domesticated animal, keep a mount from being startled, or intuit an animal's intentions, a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check is necessary. Additionally, a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check is used to control a mount when attempting a risky maneuver.

**Insight.** A Wisdom (Insight) check is used to determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching for a lie or predicting someone's next move. This involves taking note of body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

**Medicine.** A Wisdom (Medicine) check is used to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.

**Perception.** A Wisdom (Perception) check is used to spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures one's general awareness of their surroundings and the sharpness of their senses. For example, one might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, listen in on a conversation through an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or they might try to spot things that are hidden or easily missed, such as orcs lying in wait on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight coming from a secret door.

**Survival.** The GM may call for a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide a group through a frozen wasteland, identify signs of owlbears nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.

**Other Wisdom Checks.** The GM may call for a Wisdom check when attempting tasks such as the following:

* Gaining a gut feeling about which course of action to take 
* Discern whether a creature is undead, whether they appear to be living or dead 

## Spellcasting Ability 
Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
