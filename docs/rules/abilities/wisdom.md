# Wisdom 
Wisdom is a measure of one's attunement to the world around them, and is a reflection of their perceptiveness and intuition. 

## Wisdom Checks
A Wisdom check can be used to read body language, understand the feelings of another, notice small details in the environment, or to tend to an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills are all related to Wisdom checks.

**Animal Handling.** When attempting to calm a domesticated animal, keep a mount from becoming spooked, or to intuit an animal's intentions, a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check is necessary. Additionally, a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check is used to control a mount when attempting a risky maneuver.

**Insight.** A Wisdom (Insight) check is used to determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching for a lie or predicting someone's next move. This involves discerning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

**Medicine.** A Wisdom (Medicine) check is used to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.

**Perception.** A Wisdom (Perception) check is used to spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures one's general awareness of their surroundings and the sharpness of their senses. For example, one might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or one might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, such as orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.

**Survival.** The GM might ask for a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide a group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.

**Other Wisdom Checks.** The GM might call for a Wisdom check when attempting tasks such as getting a gut feeling about what course of action to follow, or discerning whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead.

## Spellcasting Ability 
Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
