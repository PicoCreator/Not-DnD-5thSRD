# Advantage and Disadvantage
At times, a special ability or spell may indicate that you have an advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When this occurs, you must roll a second d20 when making the roll. If you have advantage, use the higher of the two rolls, and if you have disadvantage, use the lower roll. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you would use the 5. If you have advantage and roll those numbers, you would use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage, you do not roll more than one additional d20. Even if two favorable situations grant advantage, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as a Halfling's Lucky trait, allows you to reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a Halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the Halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The Game Master can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.
