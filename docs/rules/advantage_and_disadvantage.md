# Advantage and Disadvantage
At times, a special ability or spell may tell you that you have an advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When this happens, you roll two d20s when you make the roll. If you have an advantage, use the higher of the two rolls, and if you have a disadvantage, use the lower roll. For example, if you have a disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you would use the 5. If you have an advantage and roll those numbers, you would use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants an advantage or imposes a disadvantage, you do not roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant an advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both an advantage and a disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose a disadvantage and only one grants an advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither an advantage nor a disadvantage.

When you have an advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as a halfling's Lucky trait, allows you to reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has an advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.

You usually gain an advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character an advantage. The Game Master can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant an advantage or impose a disadvantage as a result.
