# Conditions
Conditions can befall a creature in a variety of ways, be it through a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or some other effect. Most conditions, such as being blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as being invisible, can be advantageous.

A condition will last until it is countered, or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition. If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects do not worsen.

The following definitions explain what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

### Blinded
* A blinded creature cannot see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage. 

### Charmed 
* A charmed creature cannot attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
* The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature. 

### Deafened
* A deafened creature cannot hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing. 

### Exhaustion 
Certain special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition known as exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description. 

| Level | Effect                                         |
|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Disadvantage on ability checks                 |
| 2     | Speed halved                                   |
| 3     | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
| 4     | Hit point maximum halved                       |
| 5     | Speed reduced to 0                             |
| 6     | Death                                         |


If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. 

### Frightened
* A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
* The creature cannot willingly move closer to the source of its fear. 

### Grappled
* A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it cannot benefit from any bonus to its speed.
* The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).
* The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the **_thunder-wave_** spell.
