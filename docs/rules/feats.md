In a world of adventure and daring, feats are a representation of a character's talents and areas of expertise that grant them special capabilities. At certain levels, a character may choose to forgo the Ability Score Improvement feature in favor of taking a feat of their choice. However, they may only take each feat once, unless otherwise specified.

To take a feat, a character must meet any prerequisites specified. If they ever lose the prerequisite, they cannot benefit from the feat until they regain it. For example, the Grappler feat requires a Strength of 13 or higher. If a character's Strength is reduced below 13, they cannot benefit from the Grappler feat until their Strength is restored.

The Grappler feat grants the following benefits:

* The character has an advantage on attack rolls against a creature they are grappling.
* The character can use their action to attempt to pin a creature they are grappling. To do so, they must make another grapple check. If successful, both the character and the creature are restrained until the grapple ends.
