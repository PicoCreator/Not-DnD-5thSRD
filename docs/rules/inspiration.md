# Inspiration
Inspiration is a boon granted by the Game Master to reward players for playing their characters in a manner that is true to their personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. By using inspiration, a character can draw upon their compassionate nature to gain an edge in negotiations with a powerful figure, or call upon their bond to their home village to resist the effects of a powerful spell.

## Gaining Inspiration
The Game Master may choose to bestow inspiration upon a character for a variety of reasons. Generally, it is awarded when a character plays out their personality traits, gives in to the drawbacks of their flaws or bonds, or otherwise portrays their character in a compelling way. The Game Master will inform the players of how they can earn inspiration in the game. Inspiration is a singular boon - it cannot be stockpiled for later use.

## Using Inspiration
If a character has been granted inspiration, they may expend it when making an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Doing so grants them advantage on the roll. Additionally, if a character has inspiration, they may bestow it upon another player character who has done something that contributes to the story in an exciting and interesting way. By giving up their inspiration, they can grant the other character inspiration.
