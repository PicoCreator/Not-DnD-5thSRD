# Inspiration
Inspiration is a rule the game master may use to reward a player for acting in a manner that is true to their character's traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. By using inspiration, a player may draw upon their trait of compassion to gain an advantage when negotiating with a Beggar Prince. Or, they may call upon their bond to their home village to resist the effects of a spell.

## Gaining Inspiration
The game master may grant inspiration for a variety of reasons. Generally, they will award it when a player acts in accordance with their character's traits, gives in to the drawbacks of their flaws or bonds, or otherwise portrays their character in a compelling way. The game master will inform the players of how they may earn inspiration. Inspiration is not something that can be stockpiled for later use; a player either has it or they do not.

## Using Inspiration
If a player has inspiration, they may expend it when making an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Doing so grants them advantage on the roll. Additionally, if a player has inspiration, they may reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, the player may give up their inspiration to give that character inspiration.
