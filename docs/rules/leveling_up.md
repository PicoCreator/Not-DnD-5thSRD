Description: Rules for advancing a character in a different game world.

# Leveling Up
As your character embarks on adventures and overcomes obstacles, they gain experience, represented by experience points. When a character reaches a certain amount of experience points, they increase in capability, known as **gaining a level**.

When your character gains a level, their class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. These features may include increasing two ability scores by 1 each, or increasing one score by 2. An ability score cannot be increased above 20. Additionally, the proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.

Every time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll the Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).

When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level fighter has a Constitution score of 18, when they reach 8th level, they increase their Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing their Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. Their hit point maximum then increases by 8.

The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character's class description to see what other improvements you gain at each level.
