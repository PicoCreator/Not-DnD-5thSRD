As your character embarks on daring quests and overcomes daunting obstacles, they shall be rewarded with experience, represented by experience points. When a character accumulates a certain amount of experience points, they shall be granted a level of increased capability. This is known as **leveling up**.

When a character levels up, their class shall grant them additional features, such as the ability to increase their ability scores by either two points or one point, up to a maximum of 20. Furthermore, their proficiency bonus shall also increase at certain levels.

Each time a character levels up, they shall gain an additional Hit Die. This Hit Die should be rolled and the result added to their hit point maximum, along with their Constitution modifier. Alternatively, they may use the fixed value shown in their class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).

When a character's Constitution modifier increases by one, their hit point maximum shall increase by one for each level they have attained. For example, if a 7th-level fighter has a Constitution score of 18, when they reach 8th level, their Constitution score shall increase from 17 to 18, thus increasing their Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. Their hit point maximum shall then increase by 8.

The Character Advancement table below summarizes the experience points needed to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character's class description to see what other improvements they gain at each level.
