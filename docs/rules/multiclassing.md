Description: Rules for creating a multiclass character in a game world.

# Multiclassing 
Multiclassing is a way to gain levels in multiple classes, allowing one to mix the abilities of those classes to create a character that may not be represented by a single class.

When advancing in level, one may choose to gain a level in a new class instead of their current one. All levels in all classes are added together to determine the character's level. For example, if one has three levels in wizard and two in fighter, they are a 5th-level character.

One may remain primarily in their original class with only a few levels in another, or they may switch entirely, never looking back. They may even progress in a third or fourth class. This versatility comes at the cost of focus compared to a single-class character of the same level. 

## Prerequisites
To qualify for a new class, one must meet the ability score prerequisites for both their current class and the new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who wishes to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, one must have a natural aptitude reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

| Class     | Ability Score Minimum       |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Barbarian | Strength 13                 |
| Bard      | Charisma 13                 |
| Cleric    | Wisdom 13                   |
| Druid     | Wisdom 13                   |
| Fighter   | Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 |
| Monk      | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13  |
| Paladin   | Strength 13 and Charisma 13 |
| Ranger    | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13  |
| Rogue     | Dexterity 13                |
| Sorcerer  | Charisma 13                 |
| Warlock   | Charisma 13                 |
| Wizard    | Intelligence 13             |

## Experience Points 
The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on the total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not the level in a particular class. So, if one is a cleric 6/fighter 1, they must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before they can take their second level as a fighter or their seventh level as a cleric. 

## Hit Points and Hit Dice 
Hit points from the new class are gained as described for levels after 1st. The 1st-level hit points for a class are only gained when one is a 1st-level character.

Hit Dice granted by all classes are pooled together. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, they can simply be pooled. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if one is a paladin 5/fighter 5, they have ten d10 Hit Dice. If the classes give Hit Dice of different types, they must be kept track of separately. If one is a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, they have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice. 

## Proficiency Bonus 
The proficiency bonus is always based on the total character level, not the level in a particular class. For example, if one is a fighter 3/rogue 2, they have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3. 

## Proficiencies 
When gaining the first level in a class other than the initial class, only some of the new class's starting proficiencies are gained, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.
#### Proficiencies Gained by Multiclassing
| Class     | Proficiencies |
|-----------|---------------|
| Barbarian | Shields, simple weapons, martial weapons |
| Bard      | Light armor, one skill of choice, one musical instrument of choice |
| Cleric    | Light armor, medium armor, shields |
| Druid     | Light armor, medium armor, shields (no metal) |
| Fighter   | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons |
| Monk      | Simple weapons, shortswords |
| Paladin   | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons |
| Ranger    | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from class list |
| Rogue     | Light armor, one skill from class list, thieves' tools |
| Sorcerer  | - |
| Warlock   | Light armor, simple weapons |
| Wizard    | - |

## Class Features 
When you gain a level in a class, you receive its features for that level. You do not, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting. 

### Channel Divinity 
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again does not give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.
### Extra Attack 
If thou gaineth the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features do not add together. Thou canst not make more than two attacks with this feature unless it sayeth thou do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack doth). Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doth not give thee additional attacks if thou also hast Extra Attack. 

### Unarmored Defense 
If thou already hast the Unarmored Defense feature, thou canst not gain it again from another class.
### Spellcasting
The capacity of a spellcaster is determined by the combined levels of all their spellcasting classes, as well as their individual levels in those classes. If a character has the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, the following rules apply. If they have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, they should follow the rules as described in that class.

**Spells Known and Prepared.** Each class should be treated as if the character were a single-classed member of that class when determining what spells they know and can prepare. For example, if a character is a ranger 4/wizard 3, they would know three 1st-level ranger spells based on their levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, they would know three wizard cantrips, and their spellbook would contain ten wizard spells, two of which (the two they gained when they reached 3rd level as a wizard) could be 2nd-level spells. If their Intelligence is 16, they can prepare six wizard spells from their spellbook.

Each spell a character knows and prepares is associated with one of their classes, and they should use the spellcasting ability of that class when they cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can only be used for the spells from the class associated with that focus.

**Spell Slots.** The total number of spell slots a character has is determined by adding together all their levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half their levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. This total should be used to determine their spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.

If a character has more than one spellcasting class, the table might give them spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells they know or can prepare. They can use those slots, but only to cast their lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell they cast, such as **_burning hands_**, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, they can use the enhanced effect, even though they don't have any spells of that higher level.

For example, if a character is a ranger 4/wizard 3, they would count as a 5th-level character when determining their spell slots: they would have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, they wouldn't know any 3rd-level spells, nor would they know any 2nd-level ranger spells. They can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells they do know â€” and potentially enhance their effects.

**Pact Magic.** If a character has both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, they can use the spell slots they gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells they know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and they can use the spell slots they gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells they know.
