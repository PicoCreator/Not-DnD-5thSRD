In the world of fantasy, the art of multiclassing is a powerful tool for adventurers to master. By combining the abilities of two or more classes, a character can create a unique concept that is not found in the standard class options.

When a character advances in level, they may choose to gain a level in a new class instead of their current one. All levels in all classes are added together to determine the character's total level. For example, if a character has three levels in wizard and two in fighter, they are a 5th-level character.

In order to qualify for a new class, the character must meet the ability score prerequisites for both their current class and the new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who wishes to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher.

The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on the character's total level, not their level in a particular class. So, if a character is a cleric 6/fighter 1, they must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before they can take their second level as a fighter or their seventh level as a cleric.

When a character gains a level in a new class, they gain the hit points from that class as described for levels after 1st. The 1st-level hit points for a class are only gained when the character is a 1st-level character.

The character's pool of Hit Dice is formed by adding together the Hit Dice granted by all their classes. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, they can be pooled together. If the Hit Dice are of different types, they must be kept track of separately.

The character's proficiency bonus is always based on their total character level, not their level in a particular class.

When a character gains their first level in a class other than their initial class, they gain only some of the new class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

In the world of fantasy, the art of multiclassing is a revered one, allowing adventurers to gain access to a variety of proficiencies and abilities. The following is a list of the proficiencies gained by each class:

| Class     | Proficiencies Gained |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Barbarian | Shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons |
| Bard      | Light armor, one skill of their choice, and one musical instrument of their choice |
| Cleric    | Light armor, medium armor, and shields |
| Druid     | Light armor, medium armor, and shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal) |
| Fighter   | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons |
| Monk      | Simple weapons and shortswords |
| Paladin   | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons |
| Ranger    | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons, as well as one skill from the class's skill list |
| Rogue     | Light armor, one skill from the class's skill list, and thieves' tools |
| Sorcerer  | - |
| Warlock   | Light armor and simple weapons |
| Wizard    | - |

When a character gains a new level in a class, they gain access to its features. However, they do not receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when multiclassing. Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting are all affected by multiclassing. 

If a character already has the Channel Divinity feature and gains a level in a class that also grants the feature, they gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but they do not gain additional uses of it. Additional uses are only granted when they reach a class level that explicitly grants them. For example, if a character is a cleric 6/paladin 4, they can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because they are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever they use the feature, they can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to them from their two classes. 

### Extra Attack 
If thou gaineth the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features shall not be combined. Thou shalt not make more than two attacks with this feature unless it explicitly stateth that thou mayest (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack doth). Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade shall not grant thee additional attacks if thou already possesseth Extra Attack. 

### Unarmored Defense 
If thou already hath the Unarmored Defense feature, thou shalt not be able to gain it again from another class. 

### Spellcasting
The power of spellcasting is determined by the combined levels of all your spellcasting classes, as well as your individual levels in those classes. If you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you have only one class with the Spellcasting feature, follow the rules as described in that class.

**Spells Known and Prepared.** You must determine which spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. For example, if you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.

Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can only be used for the spells from the class associated with that focus.

**Spell Slots.** To determine your available spell slots, add together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Consult the Multiclass Spellcaster table to determine your spell slots.

If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, such as **_burning hands_**, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.

For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know — and potentially enhance their effects.

**Pact Magic.** If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

Please rewrite the above rules. In more expressive terms, for another game world, with the following guidelines.

### Spellcasting
The strength of your magical abilities is determined by the combined levels of all your spellcasting classes, as well as your individual levels in those classes. If you possess the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you only have the Spellcasting feature from one class, follow the rules as described in that class.

**Spells Known and Prepared.** You must determine which spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. For example, if you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class.

If a lower-level spell that you cast, such as **_burning hands_**, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.

For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know — and potentially increase their potency.

**Pact Magic.** If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

In the world of Multiclass Spellcasters, the number of Spell Slots per Spell Level is as follows:

At the First Level, a Spellcaster is granted two Spell Slots.
At the Second Level, a Spellcaster is granted three Spell Slots.
At the Third Level, a Spellcaster is granted four Spell Slots, and two additional Spell Slots at the Fourth Level.
At the Fifth Level, a Spellcaster is granted four Spell Slots, three additional Spell Slots at the Sixth Level, and two additional Spell Slots at the Seventh Level.
At the Eighth Level, a Spellcaster is granted four Spell Slots, three additional Spell Slots at the Ninth Level, and one additional Spell Slot at the Tenth Level.
At the Eleventh Level, a Spellcaster is granted four Spell Slots, three additional Spell Slots at the Twelfth Level, two additional Spell Slots at the Thirteenth Level, and one additional Spell Slot at the Fourteenth Level.
At the Fifteenth Level, a Spellcaster is granted four Spell Slots, three additional Spell Slots at the Sixteenth Level, two additional Spell Slots at the Seventeenth Level, and one additional Spell Slot at the Eighteenth Level.
At the Nineteenth Level, a Spellcaster is granted four Spell Slots, three additional Spell Slots at the Twentieth Level, two additional Spell Slots at the Twenty-First Level, and one additional Spell Slot at the Twenty-Second Level.

In the realm of Multiclass Spellcasters, the number of Spell Slots per Spell Level is thusly determined, granting a Spellcaster the power to cast their spells with greater potency and accuracy.
