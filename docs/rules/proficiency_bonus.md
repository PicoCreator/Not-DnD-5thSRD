In the world of fantasy, characters and monsters alike are granted a proficiency bonus based on their level. This bonus is used to enhance their ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.

Though the bonus may be applied to a single die roll or number more than once, it should only be added once. In some cases, the bonus may be multiplied or divided before it is applied. For instance, a rogue's Expertise feature may double the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a feature or effect suggests that the bonus should be applied more than once, it should still only be added once and multiplied or divided only once.

If a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn't normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, the bonus should still not be added to the check. In this case, the proficiency bonus is 0, as multiplying 0 by any number is still 0.

In general, the proficiency bonus should not be multiplied for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.
