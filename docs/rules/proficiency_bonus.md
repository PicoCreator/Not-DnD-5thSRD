# Proficiency Bonus
Characters and monsters alike have a proficiency bonus that is determined by their level. This bonus is used when making ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.

Your proficiency bonus should not be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules state that you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you should still only add the bonus once when you make the save.

At times, your proficiency bonus may be multiplied or divided (halved or doubled, for instance) before you apply it. For example, the rogue's Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a situation suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you should still only add it once and multiply or divide it only once.

Likewise, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that would not normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you should still not add the bonus to the check. In this case, your proficiency bonus is 0, as multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you will not gain any benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.

In general, you should not multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules should still apply.
