# Casting a Spell 
When a character casts any enchantment, the same essential principles are followed, paying little mind to the character's class or the spell's impacts.

Each spell portrayal starts with a square of data, including the spell's name, level, school of enchantment, throwing time, range, segments, and term. The remainder of a spell section portrays the spell's impact. 

## Casting Time 
Most spells require a solitary activity to cast, yet some spells require a reward activity, a response, or significantly more time to cast. 

### Bonus Action 
A spell cast with a reward activity is especially quick. You should utilize a reward activity on your turn to cast the spell, gave that you haven't just taken a reward activity this turn. You can't cast another spell during a similar turn, with the exception of a cantrip with a throwing time of 1 activity. 

### Reactions 
Some spells can be cast as responses. These spells take a small amount of a second to bring about and are cast in light of some occasion. On the off chance that a spell can be cast as a response, the spell portrayal discloses to you precisely when you can do as such. 

### Longer Casting Times 
Certain spells (including spells cast as services) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a throwing time longer than a solitary activity or response, you should spend your activity each turn throwing the spell, and you should keep up your fixation while you do as such. On the off chance that your fixation is broken, the spell fizzles, yet you don't expend a spell opening. On the off chance that you need to attempt throwing the spell once more, you should begin once again. 

## Range 
The objective of a spell must be inside the spell's range. For a spell like **_magic missile_**, the objective is a creature. For a spell like **_fireball_**, the objective is the purpose in space where the ball of fire ejects.

Most spells have ranges communicated in feet. A few spells can just focus on a creature (including you) that you contact. Different spells, for example, the **_shield_** spell, influence just you. These spells have a range of self.

Spells that make cones or lines of impact that start from you additionally have a range of self, demonstrating that the beginning purpose of the spell's impact must be you.

Once a spell is cast, its impacts aren't restricted by its range, except if the spell's portrayal says something else. 

## Components 
A spell's segments are the physical prerequisites you should meet so as to cast it. Each spell's portrayal shows whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) segments. On the off chance that you can't give one or a greater amount of a spell's segments, you are not able to cast the spell. 

### Verbal (V) 
Most spells require the singing of mystic words. The words themselves aren't the wellspring of the spell's intensity; rather, the specific blend of sounds, with explicit pitch and reverberation, sets the strings of enchantment in movement. Subsequently, a character who is gagged or in a zone of quiet, for example, one made by the **_silence_** spell, can't cast a spell with a verbal segment.

### Somatic (S) 
Spellcasting signals may incorporate a powerful gesticulation or a confused arrangement of signals. On the off chance that a spell requires a somatic segment, the caster must have free utilization of in any event one hand to play out these signals. 

### Material (M) 
Throwing a few spells requires explicit items, determined in sections in the segment passage. A character can utilize a **component pouch** or a **spellcasting focus** (found in “Equipment”) rather than the segments determined for a spell. Be that as it may, if a cost is shown for a segment, a character must have that specific segment before he or she can cast the spell.

On the off chance that a spell expresses that a material segment is devoured by the spell, the caster must give this segment for each throwing of the spell. A spellcaster must have a hand free to get to a spell's material segments--or to hold a spellcasting focus--however it very well may be a similar hand that he or she uses to play out somatic segments. 

## Duration 
A spell's term is the length of time the spell perseveres. A term can be communicated in adjusts, minutes, hours, or even years. A few spells determine that their impacts last until the spells are scattered or decimated. 

### Instantaneous 
Numerous spells are momentary. The spell harms, mends, makes, or alters a creature or an item in a way that can't be scattered, in light of the fact that its enchantment exists just for a minute.
### Concentration 
Certain magicks require one to maintain their concentration in order to keep the enchantment active. If one's concentration is broken, the spell will end.

If a spell must be maintained with concentration, it will be stated in its Duration entry, and the spell will specify how long one can concentrate on it. One can end concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activities, such as moving and attacking, do not interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:

* **Casting another spell that requires concentration.** One loses concentration on a spell if they cast another spell that requires concentration. One cannot concentrate on two spells at once.

* **Taking damage.** Whenever one takes damage while they are concentrating on a spell, they must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain their concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage taken, whichever number is higher. If one takes damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, they must make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.

* **Being incapacitated or killed.** One loses concentration on a spell if they are incapacitated or if they die.

The GM may also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over one while they are on a storm-tossed ship, require one to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell. 

## Targets 
A typical spell requires one to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description will tell one whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).

Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature may not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature's thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise. 

### A Clear Path to the Target 
To target something, one must have a clear path to it, so it cannot be behind total cover. If one places an area of effect at a point that they cannot see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between them and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction. 

### Targeting Oneself 
If a spell targets a creature of one's choice, they can choose themselves, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than them. If they are in the area of effect of a spell they cast, they can target themselves. Areas of Effect Spells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.

## Areas of Effect 
Spells such as **_burning hands_** and **_cone of cold_** cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.

A spell's description will specify its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a **point of origin**, a location from which the spell's energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how one positions its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.

A spell's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location is not included in the spell's area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover. 

### Cone 
A cone extends in a direction one chooses from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length.

A cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless one decides otherwise.
### Cube 
One must select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as the length of each side.

The point of origin of a cube is not included in the cube's area of effect, unless otherwise decided. 

### Cylinder 
The point of origin of a cylinder is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder spreads in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell's effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.

The point of origin of a cylinder is included in the cylinder's area of effect. 

### Line 
A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.

The point of origin of a line is not included in the line's area of effect, unless otherwise decided. 

### Sphere 
One must select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.

The point of origin of a sphere is included in the sphere's area of effect. 

## Saving Throws 
Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers. 

## Attack Rolls 
Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.

Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't incapacitated. 

> #### The Schools of Magic 
> Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.

> The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.

> **Abjuration** spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other realms of existence.

> **Conjuration** spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster's side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.

> **Divination** spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.

> **Enchantment** spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.

> **Evocation** spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.

> **Illusion** spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.

> **Necromancy** spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.

> Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.

> **Transmutation** spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster's command, or enhance a creature's innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury. 

## Combining Magical Effects 
The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect--such as the highest bonus--from those castings applies while their durations overlap.

For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same target, that character gains the spell's benefit only once; he or she doesn't get to roll two bonus dice.
