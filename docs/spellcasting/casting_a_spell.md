# Casting a Spell 
When a character desires to cast a spell, they must follow the same basic rules, regardless of their class or the spell's effects.

Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell's name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect. 

## Casting Time 
Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast. 

### Bonus Action 
A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. The caster must use a bonus action on their turn to cast the spell, provided that they haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. They cannot cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action. 

### Reactions 
Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so. 

### Longer Casting Times 
Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so. If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. If you wish to try casting the spell again, you must start anew. 

## Range 
The target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like **_magic missile_**, the target is a creature. For a spell like **_fireball_**, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.

Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the **_shield_** spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.

Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell's effect must be you.

Once a spell is cast, its effects are not limited by its range, unless the spell's description says otherwise. 

## Components 
A spell's components are the physical requirements one must meet in order to cast it. Each spell's description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If one cannot provide one or more of a spell's components, they are unable to cast the spell. 

### Verbal (V) 
Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves are not the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the **_silence_** spell, cannot cast a spell with a verbal component.

### Somatic (S) 
Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures. 

### Material (M) 
Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a **component pouch** or a **spellcasting focus** (found in “Equipment”) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before they can cast the spell.

If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell. A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell's material components--or to hold a spellcasting focus--but it can be the same hand that they use to perform somatic components. 

## Duration 
A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed. 

### Instantaneous 
Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that cannot be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.

# Casting a Spell

### Verbal (V) 
Most spells require the chanting of mystic words.

Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the **_silence_** spell, cannot cast a spell with a verbal component.

### Somatic (S) 
Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.

A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell's material components--or to hold a spellcasting focus--but it can be the same hand that they use to perform somatic components. 

## Duration 
A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed. 

### Instantaneous 
Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that cannot be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant. 

### Concentration 
Certain magicks require a wizard to maintain their concentration in order to keep their enchantments active. If the wizard loses their concentration, the spell will be broken.

If a spell must be maintained with concentration, it will be noted in its Duration entry, and the spell will specify how long the wizard can concentrate on it. The wizard can end their concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activities, such as moving and attacking, will not interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:

* **Casting another spell that requires concentration.** The wizard will lose concentration on a spell if they cast another spell that requires concentration. It is impossible to concentrate on two spells at once.

* **Taking damage.** Whenever the wizard takes damage while they are concentrating on a spell, they must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain their concentration. The DC is equal to 10 or half the damage taken, whichever number is higher. If the wizard takes damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, they must make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.

* **Being incapacitated or killed.** The wizard will lose concentration on a spell if they are incapacitated or if they die.

The Game Master might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over the wizard while they are on a storm-tossed ship, require them to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell. 

## Targets 
A typical spell requires the wizard to select one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. The spell's description will tell the wizard whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).

Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature's thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise. 

### A Clear Path to the Target 
To target something, the wizard must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover. If the wizard places an area of effect at a point that they cannot see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between them and that point, the point of origin will come into being on the near side of that obstruction. 

### Targeting Yourself 
If a spell targets a creature of the wizard's choice, they can choose themselves, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than the wizard. If the wizard is in the area of effect of a spell they cast, they can target themselves. Areas of Effect Spells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.

## Areas of Effect 
Spells such as **_burning hands_** and **_cone of cold_** cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.

A spell's description will specify its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a **point of origin**, a location from which the spell's energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how the wizard should position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.

A spell's effect will expand in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location will not be included in the spell's area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover. 

### Cone 
A cone will extend in a direction chosen by the wizard from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length.

A cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless the wizard decides otherwise. 

### Cube 
You may choose any face of the cube as its point of origin, and the size of the cube is determined by the length of each side. Unless otherwise specified, the point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect.

### Cylinder 
The point of origin of a cylinder is the center of a circle of a given radius, which may be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy of the cylinder radiates outward from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell's effect then extends from the base or top of the cylinder to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.

The point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of effect. 

### Line 
A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width. Unless otherwise specified, the point of origin is not included in the line's area of effect. 

### Sphere 
The point of origin of a sphere is chosen, and the sphere extends outward from that point with a radius in feet. The point of origin is included in the sphere's area of effect. 

## Saving Throws 
Many spells allow a target to make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell will specify the ability used for the save and the consequences of success or failure.

The DC to resist one of your spells is 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers. 

## Attack Rolls 
Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.

Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't incapacitated. 

> #### The Schools of Magic 
> Academies of magic have long divided spells into eight categories known as the schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, believe that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it is derived from rigorous study or bestowed by a deity.

> The schools of magic are used to describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.

> **Abjuration** spells are primarily protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They can create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.

> **Conjuration** spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster's side, while others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.

> **Divination** spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.

> **Enchantment** spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.

> **Evocation** spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning, while others channel positive energy to heal wounds.

> **Illusion** spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They can cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.

> **Necromancy** spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.

> Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as animate dead is an act of evil, and only wicked casters use such spells frequently.

> **Transmutation** spells alter the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They can turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster's command, or enhance a creature's innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury. 

## Combining Magical Effects 
When the effects of different spells overlap, their effects combine. However, the effects of the same spell cast multiple times do not combine; instead, the most potent effect--such as the highest bonus--from those castings applies while their durations overlap.

For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same target, that character gains the spell's benefit only once; they do not get to roll two bonus dice.
