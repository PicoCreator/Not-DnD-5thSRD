# Acidic Bolt
_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** One action  
**Range:** Ninety feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an adderâ€™s stomach)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

A shimmering green bolt of energy streaks towards its target within range and bursts into a shower of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a successful hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the bolt splashes the target with acid, dealing half the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.
