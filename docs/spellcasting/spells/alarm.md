# Ward of Warning
_1st-level Abjuration (Ritual)_

**Casting Time:** One minute    
**Range:** Thirty feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire)    
**Duration:** Eight hours 

You set a ward of warning against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a twenty-foot cube. Until the spell ends, a warning alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the warning. You also choose whether the warning is mental or audible.    
A mental warning alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within one mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.    
An audible warning produces the sound of a hand bell for ten seconds within sixty feet.
