This spell allows you to charm a beast, so that it may not harm you. Select a beast that you can see within range, and it must be able to both see and hear you. If the beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must pass a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell's duration. If you or any of your companions cause harm to the target, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional beast per level above 1st.
