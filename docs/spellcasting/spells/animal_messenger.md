# Animal Messenger 
_2nd-level enchantment (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Thirty feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food)    
**Duration:** Twenty-four hours 

By means of this spell, you can employ an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You must specify a location which you have visited before, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as "a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard" or "a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat." You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast will travel for the duration of the spell towards the specified location, covering about fifty miles per twenty-four hours for a flying messenger, or twenty-five miles for other animals.    
When the messenger arrives, it will deliver your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger will only speak to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger does not reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast will make its way back to where you cast this spell. 

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by forty-eight hours for each slot level above 2nd.
