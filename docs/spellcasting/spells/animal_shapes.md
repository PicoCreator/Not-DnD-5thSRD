Your magic allows you to transform willing creatures into beasts. Select any number of creatures that you can see within range and transform them into the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of four or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.    
The transformation persists for the duration of each target, or until the target is reduced to zero hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for each target. The target's game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to zero hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage does not reduce the creature's normal form to zero hit points, it is not knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it cannot speak or cast spells.    
The target's gear melds into the new form. The target cannot activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
