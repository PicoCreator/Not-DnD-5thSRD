# Ward of the Ancients
_5th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action   
**Range:** Self (10-foot radius)    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 

A shimmering shield spreads out from you in a 10-foot radius and follows you, staying centered on you and barring out creatures other than undead and constructs. The ward persists for the duration.

The shield prevents any affected creature from passing through or reaching it. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach weapons through the ward.

If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the ward, the spell ends.
