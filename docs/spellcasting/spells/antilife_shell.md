# Ward of the Ancients
_5th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** One action   
**Range:** Self (10-foot radius)    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one hour 

A shimmering shield of protection extends from your person in a 10-foot radius, keeping all but the undead and constructs at bay. This ward remains centered on you and lasts for the duration of the spell. 

The ward prevents any creature from passing through or reaching you. However, affected creatures may still cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach weapons through the barrier. 

Should you move in such a way that an affected creature is forced to pass through the ward, the spell will be broken.
