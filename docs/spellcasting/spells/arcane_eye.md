_4th-level divination_

**Casting Time:** One action   
**Range:** Thirty feet   
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of bat fur)   
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one hour 

You conjure an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.    
You receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to thirty feet. The eye can survey in all directions.    
As an action, you can move the eye up to thirty feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can travel, but it cannot enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier will impede the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as one inch in diameter.
