# Magickal Lock 
_2nd-level abjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action   
**Range:** Touch   
**Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)   
**Duration:** Until dispelled 

Ye touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becometh locked for the duration. Ye and the creatures ye designate when ye cast this spell can open the object normally. Ye can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting **_knock_** on the object suppresses **_magickal lock_** for 10 minutes.    
Whilst affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increaseth by 10.
