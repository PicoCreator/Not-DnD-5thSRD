# Mystic Lock 
_2nd-level abjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** One action   
**Range:** Touch   
**Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)   
**Duration:** Until dispelled 

You lay your hand upon a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and those you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within five feet of the object, suppresses this spell for one minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting **_knock_** on the object suppresses **_mystic lock_** for ten minutes.    
While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by ten.
