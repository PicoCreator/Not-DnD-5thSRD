You conjure a blade of force that hovers within range. It remains for the duration.    
When the blade appears, you make a melee spell attack against a creature of your choice within 5 feet of the blade. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage. During the spell's duration, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the blade up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.
