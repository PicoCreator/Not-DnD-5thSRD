# Wizard's Mystical Mantle 
_2nd-level illusion_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Touch   
**Components:** V, S, M (a small square of silk)   
**Duration:** 24 hours 

You bestow a mystical enchantment upon a creature or object you touch, so that any divination spells cast upon it will reveal false information. The target can be a willing creature or an inanimate object not being carried or worn by another creature.    
You may choose one or both of the following effects, which will remain in place for the duration of the spell. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object for 30 consecutive days, the illusion will remain until it is dispelled.    
**False Aura.** You alter the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as **_detect magic_**, that detect magical auras. You can make a mundane object appear magical, a magical object appear mundane, or change the object's magical aura so that it appears to belong to a particular school of magic of your choosing. If a creature handles the object, they will be able to detect the false magic.    
**Mask.** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin's Divine Sense or the trigger of a **_symbol_** spell. You may choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects will treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.
