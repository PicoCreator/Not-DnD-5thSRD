# Augury 
_2nd-level divination (ritual)_   

**Casting Time:** One minute   
**Range**: Self   
**Components:** V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)   
**Duration:** Instantaneous   
By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you may receive an omen from a mysterious entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from the following possible omens:

* **Weal**, for fortunate results
* **Woe**, for unfortunate results
* **Weal and woe**, for both fortunate and unfortunate results
* **Nothing**, for results that are neither fortunate nor unfortunate 

The spell does not take into account any possible circumstances that might alter the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.    
If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you receive a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.
