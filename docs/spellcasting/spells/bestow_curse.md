# Bestow Curse 
_3rd-level necromancy_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action   
**Range:** Touch   
**Components:** V, S   
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You lay your hand upon a creature, and they must pass a Wisdom saving throw or be cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, you must choose the nature of the curse from the following options:

* Select one of their ability scores. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on all ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.
* While cursed, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against you.
* While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If they fail, they will be unable to take any action that turn. 
* While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.    

A **_remove curse_** spell will end this effect. At the GM's discretion, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The GM has the final say on such a curse's effect. 

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn't require concentration.
