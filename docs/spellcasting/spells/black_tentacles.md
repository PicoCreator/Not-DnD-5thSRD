# Tentacles of the Abyss
_4th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action   
**Range:** 90 feet   
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid)   
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

The ground within range is filled with writhing, ebony tentacles, transforming the area into a treacherous terrain. Any creature that enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw or suffer 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be ensnared by the tentacles until the spell ends. If a creature is already restrained by the tentacles when it begins its turn, it takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.

A creature restrained by the tentacles may attempt to free itself by making a Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC. On a successful check, the creature is freed.
