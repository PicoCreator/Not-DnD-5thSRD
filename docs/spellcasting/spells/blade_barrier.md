# Blade Wall 
_6th-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action   
**Range:** 90 feet   
**Components:** V, S   
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 
You conjure a vertical wall of spinning, razor-sharp blades made of magical energy. The wall appears within range and remains for the duration. You can create a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a circular wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.    
When a creature enters the wall's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.
