# Withering Touch
_4th-level Necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action   
**Range:** 30 feet   
**Components:** V, S   
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

A wave of necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining away its moisture and vitality. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, or suffer 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

Should you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it must make the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it. If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it does not make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
