_2nd-level Necromancy_ 

**Casting Time:** One Action

You can render a foe sightless or deafen them. Choose one creature that you can see within range and force them to make a Constitution saving throw. If they fail, the target is either blinded or deafened (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of their turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
