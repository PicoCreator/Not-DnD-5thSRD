# Astral Stride
_3rd-level Transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 Action   
**Range:** Self   
**Components:** V, S   
**Duration:** 1 Minute 

At the end of each of your turns, roll a d20. If the result is 11 or higher, you will be transported to the Ethereal Plane. If you were already on the Ethereal Plane, the spell will fail and the casting will be wasted. At the start of your next turn, or when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you will be returned to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you will appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.

Whilst on the Ethereal Plane, you will be able to see and hear the plane you originated from, which will be cast in shades of grey, and you will not be able to see anything further than 60 feet away. You will only be able to affect and be affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that are not there will not be able to perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so.
