# Blur of the Ages 
_2nd-level illusion_ 

**Casting Time:** One action   
**Range:** Self   
**Components:** Verbal   
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute   

Your form becomes a blur, shifting and wavering to all who behold you. For the duration, any creature that attempts to strike you is hindered, as they must do so with disadvantage. Those who rely on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or can see through illusions, such as truesight, are immune to this effect.
