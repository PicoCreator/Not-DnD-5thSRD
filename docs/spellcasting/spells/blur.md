# Blur 
_2nd-level illusion_ 

**Casting Time:** One action   
**Range:** Self   
**Components:** V   
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute   

Your form becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you. For the duration, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it does not rely on sight, such as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, such as with truesight.
