The next time you strike a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, the weapon glows with celestial light as you strike. The attack deals an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if it was invisible, and the target emits dim light in a 5-foot radius and cannot become invisible until the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
