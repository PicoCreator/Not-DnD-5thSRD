# Call of the Tempest
_3rd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 120 feet   
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

A storm cloud appears in the form of a cylinder, 10 feet tall and with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see 100 feet above you. The spell fails if you cannot see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that cannot accommodate the cloud).    
When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see within range. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Every creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.    
If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by 1d10. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
