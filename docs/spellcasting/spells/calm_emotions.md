# Pacify Spirits 
_2nd-level enchantment_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Sixty feet   
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute 

You attempt to quell the strong emotions of a group of people. Each humanoid within a twenty-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, you can choose one of the following two effects.    
You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.   
Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.
