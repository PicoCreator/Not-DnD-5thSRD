# Clairvoyance 
_3rd-level divination_ 

**Casting Time:** Ten minutes of concentration    
**Range:** One mile    
**Components:** V, S, M (a focus worth at least 100 gp, such as a jeweled horn for hearing or a glass eye for seeing)    
**Duration:** Up to ten minutes 

You create an invisible sensor within range in a place that is either familiar to you or unfamiliar to you. The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it cannot be attacked or otherwise interacted with.    
When you cast the spell, you choose whether to see or hear through the sensor. As your action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.    
A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from **_see invisibility_** or truesight) will see a luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist. 
```
