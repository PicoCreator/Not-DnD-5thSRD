# Deadly Miasma
_5th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** V, S   
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

You conjure a sphere of noxious, yellow-green fog, centered on a point of your choosing within range. The fog spreads around corners and lingers for the duration, or until a strong wind disperses it, ending the spell. The area is heavily obscured.

When a creature enters the area of the spell for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d8 poison damage, or half as much on a successful one. The fog affects creatures even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.

The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
