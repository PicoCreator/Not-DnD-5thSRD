# Commandment 
_1st-level enchantment_ 

**Casting Time:** One action   
**Range:** Sixty feet    
**Components:** Vocalization   
**Duration:** One round   

Speak a single word command to a creature within range. The target must pass a Wisdom saving throw or obey the command on its next turn. This spell has no effect on undead, those who do not understand the language, or if the command is directly harmful.

The following are some typical commands and their effects. Other commands may be used, and the GM will determine the target's behavior. If the target cannot follow the command, the spell ends.

**Approach.** The target moves towards you in the most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within five feet of you.

**Drop.** The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.

**Flee.** The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.

**Grovel.** The target falls prone and then ends its turn.

**Halt.** The target does not move and takes no actions. A flying creature remains aloft, provided it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
