# Command 
_1st-level enchantment_ 

**Casting Time:** One action   
**Range:** Sixty feet    
**Components:** Vocalization   
**Duration:** One round   

Uttering a single word of command, you can compel a creature you can see within range to obey your will. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or else follow your command on its next turn. This spell has no effect on undead, those who do not understand your language, or those whose command would be directly harmful to them.

The following are some typical commands and their effects. You may issue other commands, and the GM will determine how the target behaves. If the target is unable to follow your command, the spell ends.

**Approach.** The target moves towards you by the most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within five feet of you.

**Drop.** The target releases whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.

**Flee.** The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.

**Grovel.** The target falls prone and then ends its turn.

**Halt.** The target does not move and takes no actions. A flying creature remains aloft, provided it is able to do so. If it must move to remain aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to stay in the air.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
