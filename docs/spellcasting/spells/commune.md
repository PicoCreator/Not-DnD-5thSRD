_5th-level divination (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 minute    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S, M (incense and a vial of holy or unholy water)    
**Duration:** 1 minute 

You reach out to your deity or a divine messenger and pose up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your queries before the spell ends. You receive a truthful answer for each query.    
Divine beings are not necessarily all-knowing, so you may receive an "unclear" response if the question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a situation where a single-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the GM may offer a brief phrase as an answer instead.    
If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you receive no answer. The GM makes this roll in secret.
