# Commune 
_5th-level divination (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** One minute    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S, M (incense and a vial of holy or unholy water)    
**Duration:** One minute 

You reach out to your divine patron or a divine emissary and pose up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your queries before the spell's duration ends. You shall receive a truthful answer for each query.    
Divine entities are not necessarily omniscient, so you may receive an "unclear" response if the question pertains to knowledge that lies beyond the deity's understanding. In cases where a single-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the GM may provide a brief phrase as an answer instead.    
If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you will receive no answer. The GM makes this roll in secret.
