# Compulsion
_4th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Thirty feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute 

Creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. Those that cannot be charmed are automatically successful. On a failed save, the targets are affected by this spell. Until the spell ends, you may use a bonus action on each of your turns to designate a direction that is horizontal to you. Each affected target must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that direction on its next turn. It can take its action before it moves. After moving in this way, it can make another Wisdom saving throw to try to end the effect.

A target is not compelled to move into a clearly dangerous hazard, such as a fire or pit, but it will provoke opportunity attacks to move in the designated direction.
