_5th-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** A single action    
**Range:** Self (60-foot cone)    
**Components:** V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

A blast of icy air bursts forth from your hands, freezing all in its path. Every creature within a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. Those who fail are afflicted with 8d8 cold damage, while those who succeed take only half the damage.

Those slain by this spell are transformed into a frozen statue until the ice thaws.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
