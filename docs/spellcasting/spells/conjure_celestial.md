# Summon Celestial 
_7th-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 minute    
**Range:** 90 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 

You call forth a celestial of challenge rating 4 or lower, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The celestial vanishes when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.    
The celestial is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the celestial, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you give it (no action required by you), as long as they don't conflict with its alignment. If you don't give any commands to the celestial, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.    
The GM has the celestial's statistics. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you summon a celestial of challenge rating 5 or lower.
