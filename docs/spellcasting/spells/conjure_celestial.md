_7th-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 minute    
**Range:** 90 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 

You call forth a celestial of challenge rating 4 or lower, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The celestial vanishes when it reaches 0 hit points or when the spell ends.    
The celestial is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the celestial, which has its own turns. It will obey any verbal commands that you give it (no action required by you), as long as they do not conflict with its alignment. If you do not give any commands to the celestial, it will defend itself from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions.    
The GM has the celestial's statistics.
