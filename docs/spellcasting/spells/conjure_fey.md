# Summon Fey 
_6th-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 minute    
**Range:** 90 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 

You call forth a fey creature of challenge rating 6 or lower, or a fey spirit that takes the form of a beast of challenge rating 6 or lower. It appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The fey creature vanishes when it falls to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.    
The fey creature is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you give it (no action required by you), as long as they do not conflict with its alignment. If you do not give any commands to the fey creature, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.    
If your concentration is broken, the fey creature does not disappear. Instead, you lose control of the fey creature, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it may attack. An uncontrolled fey creature cannot be dismissed by you, and it fades away 1 hour after you summoned it.    
The GM has the fey creature's statistics. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 6th.
