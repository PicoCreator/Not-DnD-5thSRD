# Summon Lesser Elementals 
_4th-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 minute    
**Range:** 90 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 

You call forth elementals that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. You may choose one of the following options for what appears: 

* One elemental of challenge rating 2 or lower
* Two elementals of challenge rating 1 or lower
* Four elementals of challenge rating 1/2 or lower 
* Eight elementals of challenge rating 1/4 or lower. 

An elemental summoned by this spell dissipates when it reaches 0 hit points or when the spell ends.    
The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They will obey any verbal commands that you give them (no action required by you). If you do not give them any commands, they will defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.    
The GM has the creatures' statistics. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using higher-level spell slots, you may choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures will appear: twice as many with a 6th-level slot and three times as many with an 8th-level slot.
