# Summon Woodland Spirits 
_4th-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (one holly berry per creature summoned)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 

You call upon the spirits of the woodlands to appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears:

* One spirit of challenge rating 2 or lower 
* Two spirits of challenge rating 1 or lower 
* Four spirits of challenge rating 1/2 or lower 
* Eight spirits of challenge rating 1/4 or lower 

A summoned spirit disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.    
The summoned spirits are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned spirits as a group, which have their own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.    
The GM has the spirits' statistics. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more spirits appear: twice as many with a 6th-level slot and three times as many with an 8th-level slot.
