# Converse with Other Plane 
_5th-level divination (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 minute    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V    
**Duration:** 1 minute 

You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Communing with this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are mad until you finish a long rest. Whilst mad, you cannot take actions, cannot comprehend what other creatures say, cannot read, and speak only in gibberish. A **_greater restoration_** spell cast on you ends this effect.    
On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your queries before the spell ends. The GM answers each query with one word, such as "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or "unclear" (if the entity does not know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the GM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.
