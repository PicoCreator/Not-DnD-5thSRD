# Contact Other Plane 
_A powerful 5th-level Divination ritual_ 

**Casting Time:** One minute    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** Verbal    
**Duration:** One minute 

You attempt to make contact with a powerful being from another plane, such as a demigod, a spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity. This contact can be taxing on the mind, and so you must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. Should you fail, you will suffer 6d6 psychic damage and be driven to insanity until you complete a long rest. While in this state, you will be unable to take any actions, understand what other creatures say, read, or speak in anything other than gibberish. A **_Greater Restoration_** spell can end this effect.

On a successful save, you may ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The GM will answer each question with a single word, such as "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or "unclear" (if the entity does not know the answer). If a single word answer would be misleading, the GM may instead offer a short phrase as an answer.
