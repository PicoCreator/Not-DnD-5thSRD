# The Plague 
_5th-level necromancy_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Touch   
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Seven days 

Your touch brings forth a dread disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a successful strike, you afflict the creature with a malady of your choosing from the list below.    
At the end of each of the target's turns, they must make a Constitution saving throw. After three failed saves, the disease's effects last for the duration, and the creature ceases making these attempts. After three successful saves, the creature is cured of the affliction, and the spell ends.    
As this spell induces a natural sickness in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise alleviates a disease's effects apply to it.    
**Blinding Sickness.** Agonizing pain grips the creature's mind, and their eyes turn a milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.    
**Filth Fever.** A raging fever sweeps through the creature's body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.    
**Flesh Rot.** The creature's flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.    
**Mindfire.** The creature's mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the **_confusion_** spell during combat.    
**Seizure.** The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.    
**Slimy Doom.** The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, they are stunned until the end of their next turn.
