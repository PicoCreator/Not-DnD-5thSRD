# Contingency 
_6th-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S, M (a statuette of yourself carved from ivory and decorated with gems worth at least 1,500 gp)    
**Duration:** 10 days 

Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell--called the contingent spell--as part of casting **_contingency_**, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell does not take effect immediately. Instead, it will be triggered when a certain circumstance occurs. You must describe the circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a **_contingency_** cast with **_water breathing_** might stipulate that **_water breathing_** comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.    
The contingent spell will take effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you desire it to, and then **_contingency_** will end. The contingent spell will only take effect on you, even if it can normally target others. You can only have one **_contingency_** spell active at a time.    
If you cast this spell again, the effect of another **_contingency_** spell on you will be terminated. Additionally, **_contingency_** will end on you if its material component is ever not on your person.
