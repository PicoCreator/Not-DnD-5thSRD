# Command the Waters 
_4th-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** 300 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of water and a pinch of dust)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

Until the spell ends, you have dominion over any standing water within an area of your choosing, up to a cube of 100 feet on each side. As an action on your turn, you may choose from any of the following effects, or repeat the same effect. 
**Flood.** You cause the waters to swell, rising up to 20 feet in height. If the area includes a shore, the waters will spill over onto dry land. 
If the area is part of a larger body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other, crashing down with a mighty roar. Any vessels of Huge size or smaller that are caught in the wave's path will be carried to the other side. Any vessels of Huge size or smaller that are struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. 
The waters will remain elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect created a wave, the wave will repeat on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. 
**Part the Waters.** You cause the waters to part, creating a trench that extends across the spell's area. The separated waters form a wall to either side. The trench will remain until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The waters will slowly fill in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored. 
**Redirect the Flow.** You cause the flowing waters in the area to move in a direction of your choosing, even if the waters must flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The waters in the area will move as you direct them, but once they move beyond the spell's area, they will resume their flow based on the terrain conditions. The waters will continue to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. 
**Whirlpool.** This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can attempt to swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. 
When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, they must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use their action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. 
The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.

Until the spell ends, you have the power to control any standing water within an area of your choosing, up to a cube of 100 feet on each side. As an action on your turn, you may choose from any of the following effects, or repeat the same effect. 
**Flood.** You cause the waters to swell, rising up to 20 feet in height. If the area includes a shore, the waters will spill over onto dry land. 
If the area is part of a larger body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other, crashing down with a thunderous roar.
