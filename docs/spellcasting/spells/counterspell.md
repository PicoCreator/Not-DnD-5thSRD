# Counterspell
_3rd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** A single reaction, taken when you witness a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** S    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You attempt to disrupt a creature in the midst of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell is rendered ineffective and has no effect. If the creature is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC is equal to 10 plus the spell's level. On a successful check, the creature's spell is rendered ineffective and has no effect. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell will be rendered ineffective if its level is equal to or lower than the level of the spell slot you used.
