# Dispel Magic 
_3rd-level abjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you witness a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** S    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You attempt to disrupt a creature in the midst of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell is thwarted and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC is 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell is thwarted and has no effect. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the disrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.
