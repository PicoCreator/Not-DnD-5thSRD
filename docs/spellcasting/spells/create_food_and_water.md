# Generate Provisions 
_3rd-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 30 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You conjure forth a bounty of sustenance, enough to feed and quench the thirst of up to fifteen humanoids or five steeds for a full day. Upon the ground or in containers within range, you create 45 pounds of bland but nourishing food and 30 gallons of clean, refreshing water. The food will spoil if left uneaten after 24 hours, but the water will remain pure and untainted.
