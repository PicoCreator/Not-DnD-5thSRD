# Creation 
_5th-level illusion_ 

**Casting Time:** One minute    
**Range:** Thirty feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same type of the item you plan to create)    
**Duration:** Special 

You draw upon the shadows of the Shadowfell to conjure a nonliving object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You may also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must not exceed a 5-foot cube, and must be of a form and material that you have seen before.    
The duration of the spell depends on the material of the object. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration. 

| Material              | Duration   |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Vegetable matter      | One day      |        
| Stone or crystal      | Twelve hours   |           
| Precious metals       | One hour     |         
| Gems                  | Ten minutes |             
| Adamantine or mithral | One minute   |           

Using any material created by this spell as another spell's material component will cause that spell to fail. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.
