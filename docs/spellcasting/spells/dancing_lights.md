# Glittering Radiance 
_Evocation cantrip_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You conjure up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that dance in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one brilliant, vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light radiates dim light in a 10- foot radius.    
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must remain within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light fades away if it exceeds the spell's range.
