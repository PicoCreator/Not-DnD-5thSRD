# Glowing Embers 
_Evocation cantrip_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You conjure up to four torch-sized embers within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four embers into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each ember sheds dim light in a 10- foot radius.    
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the embers up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. An ember must be within 20 feet of another ember created by this spell, and an ember fades away if it exceeds the spell's range.
