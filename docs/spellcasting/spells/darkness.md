# Shadow of Night
_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** A single action    
**Range:** Sixty feet    
**Components:** V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or a piece of coal)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to ten minutes 

A magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range, filling a fifteen-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness creeps around corners, and those with darkvision cannot see through it. Nonmagical light cannot illuminate it.
If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.
If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled. 
```

**Range:** Sixty feet    
**Components:** V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or a piece of coal)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to ten minutes 

A magical gloom spreads from a point you choose within range, filling a fifteen-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness creeps around corners, and those with darkvision cannot see through it. Nonmagical light cannot penetrate it.
If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the gloom emanates from the object and moves with it. Covering the source of the gloom with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the gloom.
If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.
