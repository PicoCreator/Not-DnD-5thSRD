# Gloom 
_2nd-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

A magical gloom spreads from a point you select within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision cannot see through this gloom, and nonmagical light cannot illuminate it.    
If the point you select is on an object you are holding or one that is not being worn or carried, the gloom emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the gloom with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the gloom.    
If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.
