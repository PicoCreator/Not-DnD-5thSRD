# Sunlight
_3rd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Sixty feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** One hour 

A sphere of brilliant light radiates from a point of your choosing within range. The sphere is bright light and casts dim light for an additional sixty feet. 
If you choose a point on an object you are holding or one that is not being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, will block the light. 
If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the darkness is dispelled.
