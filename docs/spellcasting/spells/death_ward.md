You lay your hand upon a creature and grant them a measure of protection from death.    
The first time the target would be reduced to 0 hit points due to taking damage, they instead drop to 1 hit point, and the spell ends.    
If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill them instantly without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.
