# Ward of the Dead
_4th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Eight hours 

You lay your hand upon a creature and grant them a measure of protection from death. The first time the target would be reduced to zero hit points due to taking damage, they instead drop to one hit point and the spell ends. If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would slay them instantly without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.
