# Delayed Blast Fireball 
_7th-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 150 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

A brilliant beam of yellow light bursts forth from your pointing finger, coalescing into a glowing bead that lingers at a chosen point within range. As the spell reaches its climax, the bead blossoms with a thunderous roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail are subject to fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage, while those who succeed take only half as much.    
The spell's base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.    
If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.    
The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.
