# The Realm of the Fey 
_8th-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Sixty feet    
**Components:** S    
**Duration:** One hour 

With a wave of your hand, you conjure a mysterious portal upon a flat surface within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium-sized creatures to pass through without impediment. When opened, the door reveals a realm of the Fey, a chamber thirty feet in each dimension, constructed of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door vanishes, trapping any creatures or objects within the realm of the Fey. 

Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new realm of the Fey, or have the mysterious portal connect to a realm you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you are aware of the nature and contents of a realm created by another caster of this spell, you can have the portal connect to that realm instead.
