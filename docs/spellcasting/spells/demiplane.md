# Plane of Shadow 
_8th-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** S    
**Duration:** 1 hour 

You conjure a shadowy portal on a flat, solid surface that you can see within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a plane of shadow that appears to be an empty chamber 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door vanishes, and any creatures or objects inside the plane of shadow remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.    
Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new plane of shadow, or have the shadowy door connect to a plane of shadow you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a plane of shadow created by a casting of this spell by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its plane of shadow instead.
