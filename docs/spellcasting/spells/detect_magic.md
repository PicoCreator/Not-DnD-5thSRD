# Discern Enchantment 
_1st-level divination (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

For the duration of the spell, you can sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you detect magic in this way, you can use your action to perceive a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the vicinity that is imbued with magic, and you can discern its school of magic, if any.    
The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by a foot of stone, an inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or three feet of wood or dirt.
