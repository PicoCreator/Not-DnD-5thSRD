# Portal of Passage
_4th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 500 feet    
**Components:** V    
**Duration:** Instantaneous

With a single action, you can transport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You will arrive precisely at the desired destination, be it a place you can see, one you can imagine, or one you can describe with a combination of distance and direction, such as "200 feet straight downward" or "upward to the northwest at a 45- degree angle, 300 feet."    
You may bring along objects as long as their weight does not exceed what you can carry. You may also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.    
If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.
