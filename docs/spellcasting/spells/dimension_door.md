# Portal of Passage
_4th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 500 feet    
**Components:** V    
**Duration:** Instantaneous Y

You transport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive precisely at the desired spot. It can be a place you can see, one you can envision, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as "200 feet straight downward" or "upward to the northwest at a 45- degree angle, 300 feet."    
You can bring along objects as long as their weight does not exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.    
If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature travelling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.
