# Disguise Self 
_1st-level illusion_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** Verbal, Somatic    
**Duration:** One hour 

You can alter your appearance, including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings, until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can appear shorter or taller, thinner or fatter, or anything in between. However, you cannot change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. The extent of the illusion is up to you.    
The changes wrought by this spell are not tangible, and will not hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects will pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it will feel nothing or will feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you will bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.    
To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.
