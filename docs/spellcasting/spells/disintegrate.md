# Disintegrate 
_6th-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

A thin green ray shoots forth from your finger towards a creature, object, or magical force that you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.    
A creature that is disintegrated, and all that it is wearing and carrying, except for magical items, is reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can only be restored to life by means of a **_true resurrection_** or a **_wish_** spell.    
This spell automatically disintegrates a nonmagical object or magical force of Large size or smaller. If the target is a Huge or larger object or magical force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot- cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.
