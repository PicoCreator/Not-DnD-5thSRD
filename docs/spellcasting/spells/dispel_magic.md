# Dispel Enchantment 
_3rd-level abjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** Verbal, Somatic    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any enchantment of 3rd level or lower on the target is immediately dispelled. For each enchantment of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 plus the enchantment's level. On a successful check, the enchantment is dispelled. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically dispel the effects of an enchantment on the target if the enchantment's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.
