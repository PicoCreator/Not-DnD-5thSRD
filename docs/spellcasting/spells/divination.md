_4th-level divineth (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial offering of at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

Your magicks and offering put you in contact with a deity or one of their servants. You may ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within seven days. The GM shall provide a truthful reply, which may be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.    
The spell does not take into account any possible circumstances that may alter the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.    
If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you receive a random reading. The GM shall make this roll in secret.
