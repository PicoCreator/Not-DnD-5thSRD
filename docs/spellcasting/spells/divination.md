# Divination 
_4th-level divination (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial offering of at least 25 gold pieces, which the spell consumes)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

Your magical incantations and offering put you in contact with a divine being or their servants. You may ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that will occur within the next seven days. The divine being will provide a truthful answer, which may come in the form of a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.

The spell does not take into account any possible circumstances that may alter the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you will receive a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.
