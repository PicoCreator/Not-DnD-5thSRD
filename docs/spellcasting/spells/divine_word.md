# Divine Command 
_7th-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** A single moment of respite    
**Range:** 30 feet    
**Components:** Verbal    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You utter a divine command, imbued with the power that shaped the world at the dawn of time. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. Each creature that can hear you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect based on its current hit points:

* 50 hit points or fewer: deafened for 1 minute
* 40 hit points or fewer: deafened and blinded for 10 minutes
* 30 hit points or fewer: blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1 hour
* 20 hit points or fewer: slain instantly 

Regardless of its current hit points, a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend that fails its save is banished to its plane of origin (if it isn't there already) and can't return to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a **_wish_** spell.
