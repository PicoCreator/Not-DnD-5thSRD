A beam of crackling energy streaks forth from the caster's fingertips, hurtling towards a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. If successful, the target takes 1d10 force damage. 

As the caster's power grows, so too does the Mystic Blast. At 5th level, two beams are created, three at 11th level, and four at 17th level. The caster may direct the beams at the same target or at different ones, requiring a separate attack roll for each beam.
