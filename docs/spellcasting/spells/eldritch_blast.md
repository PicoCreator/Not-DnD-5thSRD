A ray of crackling energy streaks towards a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.
The spell creates more than one ray when you reach higher levels: two rays at 5th level, three rays at 11th level, and four rays at 17th level. You can direct the rays at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each ray.
