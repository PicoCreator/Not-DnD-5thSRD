# Entangle 
_1st-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 90 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

Vines and weeds sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square, beginning from a point within range. For the duration, these plants make the ground in the area into difficult terrain.    
Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it will be freed.    
When the spell ends, the conjured plants will wither away.
