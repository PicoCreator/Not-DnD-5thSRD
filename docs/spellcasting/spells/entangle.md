# Entangle 
_1st-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Ninety feet    
**Components:** Verbal, Somatic    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute 

From a point within range, grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground, forming a twenty-foot square. For the duration, these plants transform the area into difficult terrain.    
Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants may use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it is freed.    
When the spell ends, the conjured plants wither away.
