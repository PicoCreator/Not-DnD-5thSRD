# Astral Passage 
_7th-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Up to 8 hours 

You step into the mysterious realm of the Astral Plane, where it intersects with your current plane. You remain in the Astral Plane for the duration or until you use your action to dismiss the spell. During this time, you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, each foot of movement requires an additional foot of effort. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything there appears to be a dull grey, and you cannot see anything beyond 60 feet.    
While on the Astral Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that are not on the Astral Plane cannot perceive you and cannot interact with you, unless they have a special ability or magic that allows them to do so.    
You ignore all objects and effects that are not on the Astral Plane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from.    
When the spell ends, you are immediately returned to the plane you originated from in the spot you currently occupy. If you are in the same spot as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.    
This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on the Astral Plane or a plane that does not border it, such as one of the Outer Planes. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can target up to three willing creatures (including yourself) for each slot level above 7th. The creatures must be within 10 feet of you when you cast the spell.
