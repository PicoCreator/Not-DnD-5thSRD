# Phantasmal Terror
_6th-level Enchantment_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

For the spell's duration, your eyes become a window to a realm of terror, imbued with dread power. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects of your choice for the duration. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to target another creature but can't target a creature again if it has succeeded on a saving throw against this casting of **_phantasmal terror_**.    
**Slumber.** The target falls into a deep slumber. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to rouse the sleeper.    
**Frightened.** The target is filled with terror of you. On each of its turns, the frightened creature must take the Dash action and flee from you by the safest and swiftest available route, unless there is nowhere to go. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away from you where it can no longer see you, this effect ends.    
**Sickened.** The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends.
