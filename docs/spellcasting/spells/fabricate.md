# Fabricate
_4th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You are able to transform raw materials into objects of the same material. For instance, you can fashion a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, and garments from flax or wool. 
Choose the raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the spell is dependent on the quality of the raw materials.    
Creatures or magical items cannot be created or transmuted by this spell. You also cannot use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan's tools used to craft such objects.
