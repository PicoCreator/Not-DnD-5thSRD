# Faerie Fire
_1st-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Sixty feet    
**Components:** Verbal    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute 

A brilliant light, in shades of blue, green, or violet (your choice), outlines all objects within a twenty-foot cube within range. Any creature within the area when the spell is cast must make a Dexterity saving throw or be outlined in the same light. For the duration, all affected creatures and objects shed dim light in a ten-foot radius.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object cannot benefit from being invisible.
