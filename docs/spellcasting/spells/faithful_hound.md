# Loyal Hound 
_4th-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Thirty feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread)    
**Duration:** Eight hours 

You conjure a spectral watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see within range, where it remains for the duration, until you dismiss it as an action, or until you move more than one hundred feet away from it.    
The hound is invisible to all creatures except you and cannot be harmed. When a Small or larger creature comes within thirty feet of it without first uttering the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound begins to bark loudly. The hound can see invisible creatures and can peer into the Ethereal Plane. It pays no heed to illusions.    
At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within five feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound's attack bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals four d8 piercing damage.
