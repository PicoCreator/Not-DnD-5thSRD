# Dread 
_3rd-level illusion_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Self (30-foot cone)    
**Components:** V, S, M (a white feather or the heart of a hen)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You project a spectral image of a creature's worst fears. Every creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become filled with dread for the duration.    
While filled with dread by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to go. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
