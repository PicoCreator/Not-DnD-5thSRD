# Dread
_3rd-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Self (30-foot cone)    
**Components:** V, S, M (a white feather or the heart of a hen)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute 

You project a spectral image of a creature's most terrifying fears. Every creature in a 30-foot cone must pass a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become filled with dread for the duration.
While filled with dread from this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and flee from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is no place to go. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it cannot see you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
