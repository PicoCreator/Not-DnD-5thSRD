# Feathery Descent 
_1st-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** A single reaction, taken when a creature or yourself within 60 feet of you falls    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V, M (a small feather or piece of down)    
**Duration:** 1 minute 

Choose up to five plummeting creatures within range. The rate of descent of the falling creature is slowed to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If the creature touches the ground before the spell ends, it will not suffer any falling damage and can land on its feet, and the spell will end for that creature.
