# Feeblemind 
_8th-level enchantment_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** One hundred and fifty feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of clay, crystal, glass, or mineral spheres)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You unleash a blast of mental energy at a creature you can see within range, attempting to shatter its intellect and personality. The target takes 4d6 psychic damage and must make an Intelligence saving throw.    
On a failed save, the creature's Intelligence and Charisma scores become one. The creature can no longer cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can, however, recognize its friends, follow them, and even protect them.    
At the end of every thirty days, the creature can repeat its saving throw against this spell. If it succeeds on its saving throw, the spell ends.    
The spell can also be ended by **_greater restoration_**, **_heal_**, or **_wish_**.
