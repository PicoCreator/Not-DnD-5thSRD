# Feeblemind
_An 8th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** One hundred and fifty feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of clay, crystal, glass, or mineral spheres)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You unleash a powerful blast of arcane energy at the mind of a creature within range, attempting to shatter its intellect and personality. The target takes 4d6 psychic damage and must make an Intelligence saving throw.    
Should the creature fail its saving throw, its Intelligence and Charisma scores become one. The creature is unable to cast spells, activate magical items, comprehend language, or communicate in any intelligible way. However, the creature can still recognize its allies, follow them, and even protect them.    
At the end of every thirty days, the creature can attempt its saving throw against this spell once more. If it succeeds, the spell is broken.    
The spell can also be broken by the use of **_Greater Restoration_**, **_Heal_**, or **_Wish_**.
