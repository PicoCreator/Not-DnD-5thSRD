# Summon Steed 
_2nd-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes    
**Range:** 30 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You call forth a spirit that takes the form of a strong, intelligent, and loyal steed, forming a lasting bond between the two of you. It appears in an unoccupied space within range, and you may choose its form: a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your GM may allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or lower, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it can understand one language of your choice that you speak.    
Your steed serves you as a mount, both in and out of combat, and you have a natural connection with it that allows you to fight as one. When mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.    
When the steed's hit points drop to 0, it vanishes, leaving no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its maximum hit points.    
While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.    
You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.
