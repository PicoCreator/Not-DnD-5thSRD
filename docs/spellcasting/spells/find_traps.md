# Detect Traps 
_2nd-level divination_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You are able to sense the presence of any traps within range that are visible to you. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes any mechanism that would cause sudden and unexpected harm or misfortune, crafted with the intent of doing so by its creator. Thus, the spell would detect an area affected by the **_alarm_** spell, a **_glyph of warding_**, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.    
This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You do not learn the exact location of each trap, but you do gain knowledge of the general nature of the danger posed by the trap.
