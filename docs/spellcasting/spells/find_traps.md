# Detect Traps 
_2nd-level divination_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You can sense the presence of any traps within range that are within your line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes any sudden or unexpected effect that is considered harmful or undesirable, and was specifically created as such. Thus, the spell would detect an area affected by the **_alarm_** spell, a **_glyph of warding_**, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.    
This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don't learn the exact location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.
