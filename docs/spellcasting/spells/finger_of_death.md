# Touch of Doom
_7th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You send a wave of negative energy towards a creature that you can see within range, causing it intense agony. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.    
A humanoid slain by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a zombie that is eternally under your control, following your verbal commands to the best of its ability.
