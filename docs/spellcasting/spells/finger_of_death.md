# Hand of Doom 
_7th-level necromancy_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You send a wave of negative energy through a creature that you can see within range, causing it to writhe in agony. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.    
Any humanoid slain by this spell will rise again at the start of your next turn, transformed into a zombie that is eternally bound to your will, obediently following your every command to the best of its ability.
