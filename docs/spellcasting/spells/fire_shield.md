# Fire Shield
_4th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or a firefly)    
**Duration:** Ten minutes 

A shimmering veil of flames encircles your body for the duration, radiating a brilliant light in a 10-foot radius and a dim light for an additional 10 feet. You may end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.    
The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.    
In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you strikes you with a melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 fire damage from a warm shield, or 2d8 cold damage from a cold shield.
