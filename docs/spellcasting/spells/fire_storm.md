_7th-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 150 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

A tempest of roaring flames appears in a location of your choosing within range. The area of the tempest consists of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail take 7d10 fire damage, while those who succeed take half as much.    
The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that are not being worn or carried. If you choose, plant life in the area is unaffected by this spell.
