# Blazing Tempest 
_7th-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** 150 feet    
**Components:** Verbal, Somatic    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

A tempest of roaring flames appears in a location of your choosing within range. The area of the storm is comprised of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Every creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail the save take 7d10 fire damage, while those who succeed take only half the damage.    
The fire damages objects in the area and ignites any flammable objects that are not being worn or carried. If you so choose, plant life in the area is unaffected by this spell.
