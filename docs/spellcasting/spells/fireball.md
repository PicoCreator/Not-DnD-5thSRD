# Fireblast 
_3rd-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 150 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

A bright streak of light shoots from your finger to a point of your choosing within range, and then bursts into a loud explosion of flame. Every creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail the save take 8d6 fire damage, while those who succeed take half as much.
The fire spreads around corners and ignites any flammable objects in the area that are not being worn or carried. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
