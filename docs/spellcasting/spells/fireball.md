# Blazing Inferno
_3rd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** One hundred and fifty feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

A brilliant streak of light shoots forth from your finger, illuminating the area around it. Upon reaching its destination, a loud roar is heard as a massive explosion of flame erupts. Every creature within a twenty-foot radius of the point must make a Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail are subject to eight-fold damage from the fire, while those who succeed take only half the damage.
The fire spreads around corners, and any flammable objects in the area that are not being worn or carried will be set ablaze.

**At Higher Levels.** When this spell is cast using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by one-fold for each slot level above 3rd.
