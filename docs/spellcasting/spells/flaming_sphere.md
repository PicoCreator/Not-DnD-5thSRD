# Blazing Globe
_2nd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

A 5-foot-diameter globe of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and persists for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the globe must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.    
As a bonus action, you can move the globe up to 30 feet. If you thrust the globe into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the globe's damage, and the globe stops moving this turn.    
When you move the globe, you can direct it over obstacles up to 5 feet tall and leap it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The globe ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
