# Stone to Flesh
_6th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of lime, water, and earth)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into flesh. If the target's body is made of stone, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its body begins to soften. On a successful save, the creature isn't affected.    
A creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to flesh and subjected to the living condition for the duration. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.    
If the creature is physically broken while living, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.    
If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to flesh until the effect is removed.
