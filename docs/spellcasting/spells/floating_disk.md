# Levitating Disc 
_1st-level conjuration (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Thirty feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of mercury)    
**Duration:** One hour 

This spell conjures a circular, horizontal plane of force, three feet in diameter and one inch thick, that hovers three feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disc remains for the duration, and can bear up to five hundred pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell is broken, and everything on the disc falls to the ground.    
The disc is immobile while you are within twenty feet of it. If you move more than twenty feet away from it, the disc follows you so that it remains within twenty feet of you. It can traverse uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it cannot cross an elevation change of ten feet or more. For example, the disc cannot move across a ten-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.    
If you move more than one hundred feet from the disc (typically because it cannot move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell is broken.
