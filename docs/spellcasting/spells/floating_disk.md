# Levitating Plate 
_1st-level conjuration (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 30 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of quicksilver)    
**Duration:** 1 hour 

This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that hovers 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The plate remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the plate falls to the ground.    
The plate is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the plate follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can traverse uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the plate can't move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.    
If you move more than 100 feet from the plate (typically because it can't move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.
