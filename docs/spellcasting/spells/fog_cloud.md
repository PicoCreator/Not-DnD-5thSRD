# Mist of Mystery 
_1st-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** Verbal, Somatic    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one hour 

You conjure a sphere of mysterious fog, centered on a point within range. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It remains in place until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.
