_7th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** One hundred feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)    
**Duration:** One hour 

An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force appears in an area of your choosing within range. You may choose for the prison to be a cage or a solid box. 

A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to twenty feet on a side and is made from half-inch diameter bars spaced half an inch apart. A prison in the shape of a box can be up to ten feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area. 

When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the prison's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area. 

A creature inside the prison cannot leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature attempts to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the prison, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the prison. On a failure, the creature cannot exit the prison and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The prison also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. 

This spell cannot be dispelled by _dispel magic_.
