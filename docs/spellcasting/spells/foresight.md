_9th-level divination_ 

**Casting Time:** One minute    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (a hummingbird feather)    
**Duration:** Eight hours 

You lay your hand upon a willing creature and grant them a glimpse of the near future. For the duration, the target is unable to be taken by surprise and has an advantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally, any other creature that attempts to attack the target has a disadvantage on their attack roll for the duration.    
This spell will immediately end if you cast it again before its duration has expired.
