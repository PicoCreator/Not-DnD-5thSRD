# Freedom of Motion
_4th-level Abjuration_

**Casting Time:** One Action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (a leather strap, bound around the arm or a similar appendage)    
**Duration:** One Hour 

You lay your hand upon a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is not hindered by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither slow the target's speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.    
The target can also expend five feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical bonds, such as manacles or a creature that has grappled them. Lastly, being submerged in water does not impose any penalties on the target's movement or attacks.
