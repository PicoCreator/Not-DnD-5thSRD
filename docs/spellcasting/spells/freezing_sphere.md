# Glacial Orb 
_6th-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 300 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

A frigid sphere of icy energy hurtles from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it detonates in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.    
If the orb strikes a body of water or a liquid that is mainly water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice remains for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of the frozen water are entrapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.    
You can choose to not fire the orb after completing the spell, if you wish. A small orb about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the orb to can throw the orb (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling's normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the orb down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the orb hasn't already shattered, it explodes. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.
