# Vaporous Form 
_3rd-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 

You transform a willing creature you touch, along with all it is wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature is not affected.    
In this form, the target's only way of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target cannot fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.    
In the form of a misty cloud, the target cannot speak or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding cannot be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target cannot attack or cast spells.
