_3rd-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 

You bestow upon a willing creature you touch, along with all their possessions, the ability to transform into a misty cloud for the duration of the spell. Should the creature's hit points drop to zero, the spell will end. Incorporeal creatures are not affected.    
In this form, the target is able to move with a flying speed of 10 feet. They can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target is granted resistance to nonmagical damage, and they have advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though liquids are treated as solid surfaces. The target is unable to fall and will remain hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.    
In the form of a misty cloud, the target is unable to speak or manipulate objects, and any objects they were carrying or holding cannot be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target is unable to attack or cast spells.
