# Geas
_5th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** One minute    
**Range:** Sixty feet    
**Components:** V    
**Duration:** Thirty days 

You can place a magical command upon a creature that you can see within range, compelling it to carry out some service or abstain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can comprehend you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. Whilst the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner contrary to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that cannot understand you is unaffected by the spell.    
You can issue any command you choose, except for an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A **_remove curse_**, **_greater restoration_**, or **_wish_** spell also ends it. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is one year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.
