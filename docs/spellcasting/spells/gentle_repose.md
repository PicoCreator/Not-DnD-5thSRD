# Preserve the Dead 
_2nd-level necromancy (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse's eyes, which must remain there for the duration)    
**Duration:** Ten days 

You lay your hands upon a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is safeguarded from decay and cannot become an undead.    
The spell also effectively extends the time limit on reviving the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell do not count against the time limit of spells such as **_raise dead_**.
