# Monstrous Insects 
_4th-level transmutation_  

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 30 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

You transmute up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into monstrous versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a monstrous centipede, a spider becomes a monstrous spider, a wasp becomes a monstrous wasp, and a scorpion becomes a monstrous scorpion.    
Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.    
A creature remains in its monstrous size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.    
The GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transmute a bee, its monstrous version might have the same statistics as a monstrous wasp.
