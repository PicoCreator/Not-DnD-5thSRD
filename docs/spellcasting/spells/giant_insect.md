# Grand Insects 
_4th-level transmutation_  

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Thirty feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to ten minutes 

You use your magical power to transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into grand versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a grand centipede, a spider becomes a grand spider, a wasp becomes a grand wasp, and a scorpion becomes a grand scorpion.    
Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.    
A creature remains in its grand size for the duration, until it drops to zero hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.    
The GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its grand version might have the same statistics as a grand wasp.
