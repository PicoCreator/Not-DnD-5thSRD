# Globe of Invulnerability
_6th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Self (10-foot radius)    
**Components:** V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead that shatters when the spell ends)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute 

A shimmering barrier of protection springs into existence around you, creating a 10-foot radius of invulnerability. Any spell of fifth level or lower cast from outside the barrier is unable to affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of seventh level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above sixth.
