# Protector of the Faith
_4th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 30 feet    
**Components:** V    
**Duration:** 8 hours 

A grand spectral protector appears and hovers for the duration in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The protector occupies that space and is indistinct except for a shining sword and shield adorned with the symbol of your deity.    
Any creature hostile to you that moves to a space within 10 feet of the protector for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 20 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The protector vanishes when it has dealt a total of 60 damage.
