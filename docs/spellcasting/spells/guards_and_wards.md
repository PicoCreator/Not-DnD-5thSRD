# Guardians and Barriers 
_6th-level abjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of monster blood, and a small silver rod worth at least 10 gp)    
**Duration:** 24 hours 

You conjure a barrier that safeguards up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can traverse each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.    
When you cast this spell, you can designate individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, renders the speaker immune to these effects.    
**_Guardians and Barriers_** creates the following effects within the warded area.   
**Corridors.** A thick fog fills all the warded corridors, rendering them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will be convinced it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.    
**Doors.** All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an **_arcane lock_** spell. In addition, you can disguise up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the **_minor illusion_** spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.    
**Stairs.** Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the **_web_** spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while **_guardians and barriers_** lasts.    
**Other Spell Effect.** You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.

* Place **_dancing lights_** in four corridors. You can program a simple routine that the lights repeat as long as **_guardians and barriers_** lasts.
* Place **_magic mouth_** in two locations.
* Place **_stinking cloud_** in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while **_guardians and barriers_** lasts.
* Place a **_constant gust of wind_** in one corridor or room.
* Place a **_suggestion_** in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally. 

The entire warded area radiates magic. A **_dispel magic_** cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.    
You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.
