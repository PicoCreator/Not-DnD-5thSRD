# Guiding Bolt 
_1st-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** One action   
**Range:** One hundred and twenty feet    
**Components:** Verbal, Somatic    
**Duration:** One round 

A brilliant flash of light streaks towards a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a successful hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn is made with advantage, due to the mystical dim light that glitters on the target until then. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
