# Wind Blast 
_2nd-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Self (60-foot line)    
**Components:** V, S, M (a legume seed)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

A line of powerful wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts forth from you in a direction of your choosing for the spell's duration. Any creature that begins its turn in the line must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line.    
Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.    
The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.    
As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can alter the direction in which the line blasts from you.
