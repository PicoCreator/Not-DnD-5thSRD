# Wind's Fury
_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Self (60-foot line)    
**Components:** V, S, M (a legume seed)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

A powerful gust of wind, stretching 60 feet long and 10 feet wide, blasts forth from you in a direction of your choosing for the duration of the spell. Any creature that begins its turn in the line must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in the direction of the line. 
Any creature in the line must expend two feet of movement for every one foot it moves when moving closer to you. 
The gust disperses any gas or vapor, and it extinguishes any unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to flicker wildly and has a 50 percent chance of extinguishing them. 
As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can alter the direction in which the line blasts from you.
