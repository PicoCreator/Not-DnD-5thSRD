# Phantasmic Terrain 
_4th-level illusion_ 

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes    
**Range:** 300 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)    
**Duration:** 24 hours 

You cause natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range to appear, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to seem like a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to appear as a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area remain unchanged in appearance.    
The tactile characteristics of the terrain remain the same, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference is not obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.
