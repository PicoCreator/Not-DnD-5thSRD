# Phantasmagorical Landscape 
_4th-level illusion_ 

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes    
**Range:** 300 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)    
**Duration:** 24 hours 

You cause a 150-foot cube of natural terrain in range to appear, sound, and smell like some other type of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or roads can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area remain unchanged in appearance.    
The tactile characteristics of the terrain remain the same, so creatures entering the area may be able to discern the illusion. If the difference is not immediately obvious, a creature may attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, will see it as a faint image superimposed on the terrain.
