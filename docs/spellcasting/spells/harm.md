# Maleficence 
_6th-level necromancy_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Instantaneous    

You unleash a vile and insidious plague upon a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage cannot reduce the target's hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to its original state before the hour has passed.
