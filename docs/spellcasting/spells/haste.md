Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, they are granted a +2 bonus to their armor class, they have advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and they are granted an additional action on each of their turns. This action can only be used to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. When the spell ends, the target is overcome with a wave of lethargy, and cannot move or take actions until after their next turn.
