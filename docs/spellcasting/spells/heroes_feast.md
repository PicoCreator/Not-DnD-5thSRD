You bring forth a grand feast, replete with sumptuous food and drink. The feast takes one hour to consume and vanishes at the end of that time, and the beneficial effects do not take effect until the hour has passed. Up to twelve other creatures may partake of the feast.

Those who partake of the feast are granted several boons. They are cured of all diseases and poisons, become immune to poison and fear, and make all Wisdom saving throws with advantage. Their hit point maximum also increases by 2d10, and they gain the same number of hit points. These benefits last for a full day.
