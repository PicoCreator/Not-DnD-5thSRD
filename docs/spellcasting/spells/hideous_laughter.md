A creature of your choice that you can see within range is filled with a mirthful joy, and is overcome with laughter if this spell affects it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up for the duration. Those with an Intelligence score of four or less are not affected.    
At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if it is triggered by damage. On a success, the spell ends.
