Divine light radiates from you and coalesces into a gentle radiance in a 30-foot radius around you. Creatures of your choice in that radius when you cast this spell emit dim light in a 5-foot radius and have advantage on all saving throws, and other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against them until the spell ends. Furthermore, when a fiend or an undead strikes an affected creature with a melee attack, the aura flashes with brilliant light. The attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the spell ends.
