# Divine Radiance
_8th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny reliquary worth at least 1,000 gp containing a sacred relic, such as a scrap of cloth from a saint's robe or a piece of parchment from a religious text)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute 

A divine light emanates from you, coalescing into a gentle radiance that envelops a 30-foot radius around you. Creatures of your choice within that radius when you cast this spell are bathed in a dim light in a 5-foot radius and have advantage on all saving throws, while other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against them until the spell ends. Furthermore, when a fiend or an undead strikes an affected creature with a melee attack, the aura bursts with a brilliant light. The attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the spell ends.
