You select a creature that you can see within range and mystically mark it as your quarry.

If the target falls to zero hit points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature. 
**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to eight hours. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to twenty-four hours.
