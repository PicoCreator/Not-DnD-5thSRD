# Mesmerizing Motif
_3rd-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** S, M (a glowing stick of incense or a crystal vial filled with phosphorescent material)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You conjure a beguiling pattern of hues that swirls through the air within a 30-foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and then fades away. Every creature in the area who beholds the pattern must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is entranced for the duration. While entranced by this spell, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.    
The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to rouse the creature from its stupor.
