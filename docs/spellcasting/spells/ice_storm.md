# Frosty Tempest
_4th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** 300 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

A flurry of icy shards descends from the heavens, crashing into the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail suffer 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage, while those who succeed take only half the damage.

The area of effect is transformed into treacherous terrain until the end of your next turn, with the hailstones making it difficult to traverse. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
