You must touch an object throughout the casting of this spell. If it is a magical item or some other object imbued with magic, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to be used, and how many charges it has, if any. You also learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.    
If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.
