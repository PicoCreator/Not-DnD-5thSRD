By laying your hands upon an object, you can divine its secrets. If it is a magical item or some other object imbued with magic, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to be used, and how many charges it has, if any. You also learn of any spells that are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.    
If you instead touch a creature, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.
