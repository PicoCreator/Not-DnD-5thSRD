# Phantasmal Script 
_1st-level illusion (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** One minute    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** S, M (a lead-based ink worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)   
**Duration:** Ten days 

You inscribe upon parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material and imbue it with a powerful illusion that lasts for the duration.    
To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears as normal, written in your own hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is incomprehensible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.    
Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion both vanish.    
A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.
