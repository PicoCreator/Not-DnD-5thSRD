# Illusory Writ 
_1st-level illusion (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 minute    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** S, M (a lead-based ink worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)   
**Duration:** 10 days 

Thou shalt write upon parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material and imbue it with a potent illusion that lasts for the duration.    
To thee and any creatures thou designateth when thou casteth the spell, the writing appeareth normal, written in thy hand, and conveyeth whatever meaning thou intended when thou wrote the text. To all others, the writing appeareth as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, thou canst cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one thou knoweth.    
Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion both disappeareth.    
A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.
