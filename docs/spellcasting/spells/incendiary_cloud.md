# Blazing Inferno
_8th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 150 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

A swirling cloud of smoke, illuminated by white-hot embers, appears in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It remains in place until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.    
When the cloud appears, each creature within it must make a Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail suffer 10d8 fire damage, while those who succeed take only half as much. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.    
At the start of each of your turns, the cloud moves 10 feet away from you in a direction of your choosing.
