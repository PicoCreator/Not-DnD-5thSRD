# Summoning of Objects 
_6th-level conjuration (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 minute    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (a sapphire worth 1,000 gp)    
**Duration:** Until dispelled 

You lay your hand upon an object of no more than 10 pounds in weight and no more than 6 feet in length. The spell leaves an invisible mark upon its surface and inscribes the name of the item upon the sapphire you use as the material component. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.    
At any time thereafter, you can use your action to speak the item's name and crush the sapphire. The item will appear in your hand, no matter the distance, and the spell will end.    
If another creature is holding or carrying the item, crushing the sapphire will not transport the item to you, but instead you will learn who the creature is and where they are located.    
**_Dispel magic_** or a similar effect successfully applied to the sapphire will end this spell's effect.
