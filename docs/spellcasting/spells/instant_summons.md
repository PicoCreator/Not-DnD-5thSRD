# Summoning of the Ancients
_6th-level conjuration (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (a sapphire worth 1,000 gp)    
**Duration:** Until dispelled 

You lay your hands upon an object of no more than 10 pounds in weight and no more than 6 feet in length. You then take a sapphire of worth 1,000 gold pieces and inscribe upon it the name of the object. 

At any time thereafter, you may speak the name of the object and crush the sapphire in your hand. The object will then appear in your grasp, no matter the distance between you and it. 

Should another creature be holding or carrying the object, crushing the sapphire will not bring the object to you, but instead you will learn the identity of the creature and its approximate location. 

**_Dispel magic_** or a similar effect successfully applied to the sapphire will end the spell's effect.
