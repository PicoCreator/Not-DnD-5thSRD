# Knocketh
_2nd-level Transmutation_

**Casting Time:** One Action    
**Range:** Sixtieth Foot    
**Components:** V    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

Choose an object that thou canst see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.    
A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object hath multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.    
If thou choosest a target that is held shut with **_Arcane Lock_**, that spell is suppressed for ten minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.    
When thou casteth the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as three hundred feet, emanateth from the target object.
