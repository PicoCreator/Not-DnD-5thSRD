# Ancient Lore 
_5th-level divination_ 

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S, M (incense worth at least 250 gp, which the spell consumes, and four ivory strips worth at least 50 gp each)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

Name or describe a person, place, or object. The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named. The lore may include current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret knowledge that has never been widely known. If the thing you named is not of legendary importance, you will gain no information. The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.    
The information you learn is accurate but may be expressed in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magical axe, the spell might yield this information: â€œMisfortune awaits the wicked who touches the axe, for even the haft will cut the hand of the wicked. Only a true Child of Stone, beloved of Moradin, can awaken the true power of the axe, and only with the sacred word **Rudnogg** on their lips."
