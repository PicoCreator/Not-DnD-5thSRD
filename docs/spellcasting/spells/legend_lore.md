# Legends of Old
_5th-level divination_ 

**Casting Time:** Ten minutes of solemn contemplation    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S, M (incense worth at least 250 gold pieces, which the spell consumes, and four ivory strips worth at least 50 gold pieces each)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

Name or describe a person, place, or object of legendary importance. The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named. The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.    
The information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information: “Woe betide the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft shall slice the hand of the wicked. Only a true Child of Stone, beloved of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word **Rudnogg** on their lips."
