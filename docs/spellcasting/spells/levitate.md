# Soar 
_2nd-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

One creature or object of your choice that you can see within range is lifted up, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can raise a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.    
The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can alter the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can ascend or descend as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.    
When the spell ends, the target drifts down gently to the ground if it is still aloft.
