# Candlelight 
_Evocation Cantrip_ 

**Casting Time:** One Action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss)    
**Duration:** One Hour 

You lay your hand upon an object no larger than ten feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object emits a bright light in a twenty-foot radius and dim light for an additional twenty feet. The light can be coloured as you wish. Covering the object with something opaque will block the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.    
If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.
