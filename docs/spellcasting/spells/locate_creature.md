# Locate Being 
_4th-level divination_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur from a bloodhound)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 

Describe or name a being that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the being's location, as long as that being is within 1,000 feet of you. If the being is moving, you know the direction of its movement.    
The spell can locate a specific being known to you, or the nearest being of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a being up close--within 30 feet--at least once. If the being you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a **_polymorph_** spell, this spell doesn't locate the being.    
This spell can't locate a being if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the being.
