# Locate Object 
_2nd-level divination_ 

**Casting Time:** One action 
**Range:** Self 
**Components:** V, S, M (a forked twig) 
**Duration:** Concentration, up to ten minutes 

Describe or name an object that is familiar to thee. Thou shalt sense the direction to the object's location, so long as it be within one thousand feet of thee. If the object be in motion, thou shalt know the direction of its movement. 
The spell can locate a specific object known to thee, so long as thou hast seen it up close--within thirty feet--at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon. 
This spell can't locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between thee and the object.
