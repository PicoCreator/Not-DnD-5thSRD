# Mage Armor
_1st-level Abjuration_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of cured leather)    
**Duration:** Eight hours 

You lay your hands upon a willing creature who is not wearing armor, and a protective magical force envelops them until the spell expires. The target's base Armor Class becomes 13 plus their Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.
