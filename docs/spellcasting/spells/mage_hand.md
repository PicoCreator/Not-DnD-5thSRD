**Casting Time:** A single action    
**Range:** 30 feet    
**Components:** Verbal, Somatic    
**Duration:** One minute 

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point of your choosing within range. The hand remains for the duration or until you dismiss it with an action. The hand vanishes if it ever moves more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.    
You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, store or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.    
The hand cannot attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds.
