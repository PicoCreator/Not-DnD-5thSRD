# Mystic Mutter 
_2nd-level illusion (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** One minute    
**Range:** Thirty feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a small bit of honeycomb and jade dust worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)    
**Duration:** Until dispelled 

You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a certain condition is met. Select an object that you can see and that is not being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be no more than twenty-five words, though it can be delivered over a period of up to ten minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.    
When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.    
The triggering circumstance can be as general or as specific as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within thirty feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within thirty feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within thirty feet of it.
