# Grand Illusion 
_3rd-level illusion_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

You conjure forth an image of an object, creature, or other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and remains for the duration. It appears completely real, with sounds, smells, and temperatures appropriate to the thing depicted. You cannot create enough heat or cold to cause harm, a sound loud enough to cause thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that could sicken a creature (such as a troglodyte's stench).
As long as you remain within range of the illusion, you can use your action to move the image to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can make the image appear to be walking. You can also cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, if you wish.
Interacting with the image reveals it to be an illusion, as things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.
