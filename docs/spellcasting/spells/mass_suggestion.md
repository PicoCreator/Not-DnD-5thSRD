# Grand Suggestion 
_6th-level enchantment_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Sixty feet    
**Components:** V, M (a snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)    
**Duration:** Twenty-four hours 

You suggest a course of action (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you. Those who cannot be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do something obviously harmful, such as stabbing itself, throwing itself onto a spear, or immolating itself, automatically negates the effect of the spell.    
Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they pursue the course of action you described to the best of their ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.    
You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn't met before the spell ends, the activity isn't performed.    
If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is ten days. When you use an 8th-level spell slot, the duration is thirty days. When you use a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is a year and a day.

Those who cannot be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action seem reasonable and desirable. Asking the creature to do something obviously harmful, such as stabbing itself, throwing itself onto a spear, or immolating itself, automatically negates the effect of the spell.    
Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they are compelled to pursue the course of action you described to the best of their ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration.
