# Labyrinthine Demiplane
_8th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Sixty feet    
**Components:** Verbal, Somatic    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to ten minutes 

Through the power of your arcane might, you banish a creature that you can see within range into a mysterious and winding demiplane. The target remains there for the duration of the spell or until it manages to escape the maze. 
The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it must make a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes and the spell ends (minotaurs and goristro demons automatically succeed). 
When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.
