# Meld into Stone 
_3rd-level transmutation (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** 8 hours 

You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. With a single movement, you enter the stone at a point you can touch, and your presence is no longer visible or detectable by any nonmagical senses.    
Whilst merged with the stone, you cannot observe what is occurring outside of it, and any attempts to hear sounds outside of it with Wisdom (Perception) are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You are otherwise unable to move.    
Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but if it is partially destroyed or its shape changes to the extent that you no longer fit within it, you are expelled and take 6d6 bludgeoning damage. If the stone is completely destroyed (or transmuted into a different substance), you are expelled and take 50 bludgeoning damage. If expelled, you fall prone in the closest unoccupied space to where you first entered.
