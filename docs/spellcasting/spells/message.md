# Whisper 
_Transmutation cantrip_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)    
**Duration:** One round 

You point your finger towards a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.    
You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, a foot of stone, an inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or three feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell does not have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.
