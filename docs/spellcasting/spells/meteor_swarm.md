# Celestial Cataclysm
_9th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 1 mile    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

Four blazing orbs of fire descend from the heavens, crashing into four different points that can be seen within range. Every creature within a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners, and any creature that fails the saving throw will suffer 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage. Those who succeed the saving throw will only suffer half the damage. Any creature that is within the area of more than one of the fiery bursts will only be affected once. 

The spell will also damage any objects in the area and ignite any flammable objects that are not being worn or carried.
