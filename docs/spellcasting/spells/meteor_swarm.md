# Meteor Shower 
_9th-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 1 mile    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

Four blazing orbs of fire come crashing down from the heavens at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.    
The spell damages objects in the area and sets alight any flammable objects that are not being worn or carried.
