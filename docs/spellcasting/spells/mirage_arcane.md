# Phantasmal Terrain 
_7th-level illusion_ 

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes    
**Range:** Sight    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** 10 days 

You can cause the terrain in an area up to one mile square to appear, sound, smell, and even feel like some other type of terrain. The general shape of the land remains the same, however. Open fields or roads can be made to look like swamps, hills, crevices, or other impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a cliff like a gentle slope, or a rocky gully like a wide and smooth road.

You can also alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none exist. The spell does not disguise, conceal, or add creatures. The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Anything taken from the area of the illusion disappears immediately.

Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain's true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, they can still physically interact with it.
