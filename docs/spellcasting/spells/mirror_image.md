# Mirror Image
_2nd-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** Verbal, Somatic    
**Duration:** One minute 

Three illusory replicas of yourself appear in your vicinity. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it is impossible to discern which image is the true one. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.    
Whenever a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.    
If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to redirect the attack to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.    
A duplicate's AC is equal to 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can only be destroyed by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.    
A creature is unaffected by this spell if it cannot see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.
