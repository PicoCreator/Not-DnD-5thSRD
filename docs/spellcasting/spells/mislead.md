# Deceitful Mirage
_5th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** A single action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** Verbal    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one hour 

You become invisible in an instant, while an illusory double of yourself appears in your stead. This double remains for the duration, but your invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.

You may use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever manner you choose. You may see through its eyes and hear through its ears, as if you were standing in its place. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you may switch between using its senses and your own, though while using its senses, you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.
