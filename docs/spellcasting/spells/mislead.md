# Deceive 
_5th-level illusion_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 

You become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you appears in your stead. The double remains for the duration, but your invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.    
You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and act in whatever way you choose.    
You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.
