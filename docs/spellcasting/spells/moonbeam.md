# Moonbeam 
_2nd-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

A beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.    
When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, taking 2d10 radiant damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.    
Shapechangers make their saving throw with disadvantage. If they fail, they also instantly revert to their original form and cannot assume a different form until they leave the light.    
On each of your turns after casting this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
