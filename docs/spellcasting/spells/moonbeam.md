# Moonbeam 
_2nd-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** One hundred and twenty feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute 

A brilliant beam of silvery light descends from the heavens, illuminating a five-foot-radius, forty-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, a dim light fills the cylinder.    
When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes two d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.    
A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light.    
On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam sixty feet in any direction. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by one d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

**Components:** V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute 

A shimmering beam of pale light shines down from the heavens, illuminating a five-foot-radius, forty-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, a dim light fills the cylinder.
