# Move the Earth 
_6th-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (an iron blade and a small bag containing a mixture of soils--clay, loam, and sand)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to two hours 

Choose an area of terrain no larger than forty feet on a side within range. You can reshape the dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes cannot exceed half the area's largest dimension. So, if you affect a forty-foot square, you can create a pillar up to twenty feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to twenty feet, dig a trench up to twenty feet deep, and so on. It takes ten minutes for these changes to complete.    
At the end of every ten minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.    
As the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area cannot usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movement.    
This spell cannot manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it may collapse.    
Similarly, this spell does not directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.
