**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 

A veil of shadows and silence spreads from you, cloaking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this blessing leaves no trace of its passing.
