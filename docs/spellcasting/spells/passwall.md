# The Grand Passage
_5th-level Transmutation_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Thirty feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)    
**Duration:** One hour 

At a point of your choosing, visible on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, ceiling, or floor) within range, a passage appears and remains for the duration. You may choose the opening's dimensions, up to five feet wide, eight feet tall, and twenty feet deep. The passage causes no instability in the structure surrounding it.
When the opening fades away, any creatures or objects still within the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to the nearest unoccupied space on the surface on which you cast the spell.
