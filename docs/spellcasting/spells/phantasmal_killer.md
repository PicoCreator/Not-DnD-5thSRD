_4th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** One action

You tap into the darkest nightmares of a creature you can see within range and conjure an illusory manifestation of its most dreaded fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is filled with terror for the duration. At the end of each of the target's turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or suffer 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell dissipates. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.
