# Planar Binding 
_5th-level abjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** One hour    
**Range:** Sixty feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)    
**Duration:** Twenty-four hours 

This spell allows one to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to their service. The creature must remain within range for the entirety of the casting. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) Upon completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. If the saving throw is failed, the creature is bound to serve the caster for the duration of the spell. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, the duration of that spell is extended to match the duration of this spell.    
A bound creature must follow the caster's instructions to the best of its ability. The caster may command the creature to accompany them on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature will obey the letter of the instructions, but if it is hostile to the caster, it will attempt to twist the words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out the instructions completely before the spell ends, it will travel to the caster to report this fact if they are on the same plane of existence. If the caster is on a different plane of existence, the creature will return to the place where it was bound and remain there until the spell ends. 

**At Higher Levels.** When this spell is cast using a spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to ten days with a 6th-level slot, to thirty days with a 7th- level slot, to one hundred and eighty days with an 8th-level slot, and to one year and one day with a 9th-level spell slot.
