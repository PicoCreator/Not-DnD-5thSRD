# Metamorphosis 
_4th-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Sixty feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one hour 

This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with zero hit points.    
The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to zero hit points or passes away. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.    
The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to zero hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to zero hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.    
The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it cannot speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.    
The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature cannot activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
