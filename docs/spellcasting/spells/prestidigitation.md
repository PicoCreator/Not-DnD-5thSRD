**Casting Time:** One Action    
**Range:** Ten Feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Up to One Hour 

This spell is a minor magical trick used by novice spellcasters for practice. You can create one of the following magical effects within range:

* An instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
* Instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
* Instantly clean or soil an object no larger than one cubic foot. 
* Chill, warm, or flavor up to one cubic foot of nonliving material for one hour.
* Make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for one hour.
* Create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn. 

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
