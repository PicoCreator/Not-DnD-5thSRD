# Grand Protectorate 
_4th-level abjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes   
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)   
**Duration:** 24 hours 

You invoke a powerful enchantment to secure an area within range. The area is a cube, ranging from 5 feet to 100 feet on each side. The spell remains in effect for the duration, or until you use an action to dismiss it.

When you cast the spell, you can choose any or all of the following properties to be in effect:

* No sound can pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.
* The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.
* Divination spells cannot be used to detect or target creatures within the protected area, nor can they pass through the barrier at its perimeter.
* Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.
* Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.

If this spell is cast on the same spot every day for a year, the effect becomes permanent. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.
