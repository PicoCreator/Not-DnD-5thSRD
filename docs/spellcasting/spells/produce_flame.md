# Produce Flame 
_Conjuration Cantrip_ 

**Casting Time:** One Action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** Verbal, Somatic    
**Duration:** Ten Minutes 

A flickering flame appears in your hand, and it will remain there for the duration of the spell, without harming you or your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a ten-foot radius, and dim light for an additional ten feet. You may dismiss the flame as an action, or cast it again to end the spell.

You may also use the flame to attack, though doing so will end the spell. As an action on your turn, you may hurl the flame at a creature within thirty feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack, and if it hits, the target will take 1d8 fire damage.

The damage of this spell increases to 2d8 when you reach fifth level, 3d8 when you reach eleventh level, and 4d8 when you reach seventeenth level.
