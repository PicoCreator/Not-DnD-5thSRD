# Grandeur of the Ages 
_7th-level illusion_ 

**Casting Time:** A single action    
**Range:** 500 miles    
**Components:** V, S, M (a small replica of you crafted from materials worth at least 5 gp)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 day 

You conjure an illusory copy of yourself that persists for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of any obstacles that may be in the way. The illusion looks and sounds like you, but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it will vanish and the spell will end.    
You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It perfectly mimics your mannerisms.    
You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. As a bonus action on your turn, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.    
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, as things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.
