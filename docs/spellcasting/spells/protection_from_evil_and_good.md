# Ward of Protection
_1st-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to ten minutes 

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is safeguarded from certain creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.    
The protection grants several advantages. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on their attack rolls against the target. The target also cannot be beguiled, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already beguiled, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
