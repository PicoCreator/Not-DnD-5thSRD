# Ward Against Poison 
_2nd-level abjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S   
**Duration:** 1 hour 

You lay your hand upon a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the venom. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you can choose to neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you can neutralize one at random.    
For the duration, the target has an advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and it has resistance to poison damage.
