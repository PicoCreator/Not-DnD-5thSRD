# Reanimate 
_5th-level necromancy_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 hour    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You can bring a deceased creature you touch back to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature's soul is willing and able to return to its body, the creature is restored to life with 1 hit point.    
This spell also eliminates any poisons and cures any nonmagical diseases that afflicted the creature at the time of its death. This spell does not, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these are not removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature is brought back to life. The spell cannot revive an undead creature.    
This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it does not restore missing body parts. If the creature is missing body parts or organs essential for its survival—its head, for example—the spell automatically fails.    
Returning from the dead is a difficult process. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target completes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.
