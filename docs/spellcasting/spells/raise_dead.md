# Reanimate
_5th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** One hour    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You can bring a deceased creature back to life with a single touch, provided that it has been dead for no more than 10 days. If the soul of the creature is willing and able to return to its body, it will be restored to life with one hit point. 
This spell also eliminates any poisons and cures any non-magical diseases that the creature had when it died. However, it does not remove any magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these are not removed before casting the spell, they will take effect when the creature is brought back to life. This spell cannot be used to revive an undead creature. 
This spell will close any mortal wounds, but it will not restore any missing body parts. If the creature is missing any body parts or organs that are essential for its survival - such as its head - the spell will automatically fail. 
Returning from the dead is a difficult process. The target will suffer a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. This penalty will be reduced by one after each long rest until it is gone.
