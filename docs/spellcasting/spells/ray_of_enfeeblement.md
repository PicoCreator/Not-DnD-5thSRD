A dark beam of sapping energy bursts forth from your finger, directed towards a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. If successful, the target's weapon attacks that use Strength will only deal half damage until the spell ends. 
At the end of each of the target's turns, they may attempt a Constitution saving throw against the spell. If successful, the spell will be broken.
