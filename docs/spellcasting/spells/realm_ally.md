_6th-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You beseech a powerful being from beyond for aid. This being must be known to you: a deity, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to assist you, appearing in an unoccupied space within range. If you know the name of a specific creature, you can speak it when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you may still get a different creature (GM's choice).    
When the creature appears, it is not compelled to act in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it is not obligated to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to negotiate for its services.    
Payment can take many forms. A celestial may require a generous donation of gold or magical items to an allied temple, while a fiend may demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures may exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.    
As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is in line with the creature's ethos, the payment may be halved or even waived. Non-hazardous tasks usually require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks may require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.    
Once the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to come to an agreement on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.    
A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.
