# Rejuvenate 
_7th-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** One minute    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (a prayer wheel and holy water)    
**Duration:** One hour 

You lay your hands upon a creature and stimulate its natural healing power. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).    
The target's severed body parts (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after two minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell will cause the limb to knit to the stump in an instant.
