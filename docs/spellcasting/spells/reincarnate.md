# Reincarnate 
_5th-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** One hour

**Components:** V, S, M (rare oils and unguents worth at least 1,000 gold pieces, which the spell consumes)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You lay your hands upon a deceased humanoid or a fragment of a deceased humanoid. So long as the creature has been dead no more than ten days, the spell will form a new body for it and summon the soul to inhabit it. If the target's soul is not free or willing to do so, the spell will fail.    
The magic will fashion a new body for the creature to inhabit, which may cause the creature's race to change. The GM will roll a d100 and consult the following table to determine what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the GM may choose a form. 

| d100   | Race                |

| 01-04  | Dragonborn          |
| 05-13  | Dwarf, hill         |
| 14-21  | Dwarf, mountain     |
| 22-25  | Elf, dark           |
| 26-34  | Elf, high           |
| 35-42  | Elf, wood           |
| 43-46  | Gnome, forest       |
| 47-52  | Gnome, rock         |
| 53-56  | Half-elf            |
| 57-60  | Half-orc            |
| 61-68  | Halfling, lightfoot |

| 77-96  | Human               |
| 97-100 | Tiefling            |

The reincarnated creature will remember its former life and experiences. It will retain the capabilities it had in its original form, except it will exchange its original race for the new one and change its racial traits accordingly.
