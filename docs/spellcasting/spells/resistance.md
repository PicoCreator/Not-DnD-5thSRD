You lay your hand upon a willing creature, and a protective ward is bestowed upon them. Before the spell ends, the target may roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one saving throw of their choice. Whether they choose to roll the die before or after making the saving throw is up to them. The spell then dissipates.
