# Resurrecting the Fallen
_7th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** One hour    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You may touch a deceased creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that did not pass away due to old age, and that is not undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target will be restored to life with all its hit points.    
This spell will neutralize any poisons and cure any normal diseases that afflicted the creature when it died. It will not, however, remove any magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects were not removed prior to casting the spell, they will afflict the target upon its return to life.    
This spell will close all mortal wounds and restore any missing body parts.    
Returning from the dead is a difficult task. The target will suffer a âˆ’4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target completes a long rest, the penalty will be reduced by 1 until it disappears.    
Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer will take a great toll on you. Until you finish a long rest, you will be unable to cast spells again, and you will have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.
