# Reanimation 
_7th-level necromancy_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 hour    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You lay your hands upon a deceased creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that did not pass away due to old age, and that is not an undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.    
This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures any normal diseases that afflicted the creature when it died. It does not, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects were not removed prior to casting the spell, they will afflict the target upon its return to life.    
This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.    
Returning from the dead is a difficult task. The target takes a âˆ’4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target completes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.    
Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer is a taxing process. Until you finish a long rest, you cannot cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.
