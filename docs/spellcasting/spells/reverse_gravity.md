# Reverse Gravity
_A powerful 7th-level Transmutation spell_

**Casting Time:** One action 
**Range:** A hundred feet 
**Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and iron filings) 
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute 

This powerful spell reverses the pull of gravity in a fifty-foot-radius, one-hundred-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that are not somehow anchored to the ground in the area are drawn upwards, reaching the top of the area when the spell is cast. A creature may make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the ascent. 
If any solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered during the ascent, the objects and creatures will strike it as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it will remain there, oscillating slightly, for the duration. 
At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures will fall back down.
