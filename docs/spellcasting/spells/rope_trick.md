# Rope Trick 
_2nd-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment)    
**Duration:** One hour 

You touch a length of rope that is up to sixty feet long. One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.    
The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope vanish from view outside the space.    
Attacks and spells cannot pass through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can view out of it as if through a three-foot-by-five-foot window centered on the rope.    
Anything inside the extradimensional space falls out when the spell ends.
