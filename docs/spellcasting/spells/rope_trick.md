# The Mystic Rope
_2nd-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** A single action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment)    
**Duration:** One hour 

Upon touching a length of rope, no longer than sixty feet, one end of the rope will rise into the air, until the rope is perpendicular to the ground. At the top of the rope, an invisible entrance will open to an extradimensional space, which will remain until the spell ends.

The extradimensional space can be accessed by climbing the rope, and can hold up to eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making it invisible from the outside.

Attacks and spells cannot pass through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, however those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5- foot window centered on the rope.

Anything inside the extradimensional space will be released when the spell ends.
