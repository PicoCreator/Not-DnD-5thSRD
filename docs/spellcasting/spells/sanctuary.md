# Sanctuary 
_1st-level abjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** A single moment of respite    
**Range:** Thirty paces    
**Components:** V, S, M (a small silver mirror)    
**Duration:** One minute 

You bestow a blessing of protection upon a creature within range. Until the spell ends, any creature that attempts to harm the protected creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit the attack or spell. This spell does not shield the protected creature from area effects, such as the detonation of a fireball.    
If the protected creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.
