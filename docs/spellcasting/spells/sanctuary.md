# Ward of Protection
_1st-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action    
**Range:** 30 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a small silver mirror)    
**Duration:** 1 minute 

You bestow a creature within range with a shield of protection. Until the spell ends, any creature that attempts to attack the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit the attack or spell. This spell does not protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.    
If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.
