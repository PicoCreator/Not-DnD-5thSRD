# Scrying
_5th-level divination_

**Casting Time:** Ten minutes    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S, M (a focus worth at least 1,000 gp, such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with holy water)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to ten minutes 

You can observe a chosen creature on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, the difficulty of which is determined by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If the target is aware of your casting of this spell, it may choose to fail the saving throw and be observed. 

| Knowledge                                 | Save Modifier |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Secondhand (you have heard of the target) | +5            |
| Firsthand (you have met the target)       | 0             |
| Familiar (you know the target well)       | -5            |

| Connection                                        | Save Modifier |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Likeness or picture                               | -2            |
| Possession or garment                             | -4            |
| Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like | -10           |

If the target succeeds on the saving throw, it is unaffected and you cannot use this spell against it again for twenty-four hours. If the target fails, an invisible sensor is created within ten feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor follows the target, remaining within ten feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects will see the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of a fist. 

Alternatively, you may choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and does not move.

This powerful spell of divination allows the caster to peer into the soul of a chosen creature, or to a place they have seen before. By expending a focus of at least 1,000 gold pieces, the caster can cast this spell and concentrate for up to ten minutes. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, the difficulty of which is determined by the caster's knowledge of the target and the physical connection they have to it. If the target is aware of the caster's spell, they may choose to fail the saving throw and be observed. On a successful save, the target is unaffected and the caster cannot use this spell against them again for twenty-four hours. On a failed save, an invisible sensor is created within ten feet of the target, allowing the caster to see and hear through it as if they were there. The sensor follows the target, remaining within ten feet of it for the duration. A creature that can perceive invisible objects will see the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of a fist.
