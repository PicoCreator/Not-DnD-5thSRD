# Divining 
_5th-level divination_ 

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes    
**Range:** Self

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

You can view and hear a particular creature you select that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If the target is aware of your casting of this spell, it can choose to fail the saving throw willingly if it wishes to be observed. 

| Knowledge                                 | Save Modifier |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Secondhand (you have heard of the target) | +5            |
| Firsthand (you have met the target)       | 0             |
| Familiar (you know the target well)       | -5            |

| Connection                                        | Save Modifier |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Likeness or picture                               | -2            |
| Possession or garment                             | -4            |
| Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like | -10           |

On a successful save, the target is unaffected, and you cannot use this spell against it again for 24 hours.    
On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can view and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.    
Rather than targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and does not move.
