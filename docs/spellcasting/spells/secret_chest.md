# Hidden Coffer 
_4th-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (an exquisite coffer, 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet, constructed from rare materials worth at least 5,000 gp, and a Tiny replica made from the same materials worth at least 50 gp)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You ensconce a coffer, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane. You must touch the coffer and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for the spell. The coffer can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).    
Whilst the coffer remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and touch the replica to summon the coffer. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the coffer back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the coffer and the replica.    
After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spell's effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if the smaller replica coffer is destroyed, or if you choose to end the spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger coffer is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.
