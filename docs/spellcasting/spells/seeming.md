# Seeming
_5th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Thirty feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Eight hours 

This spell grants the caster the power to alter the appearance of any number of creatures within range. An unwilling target may attempt a Charisma saving throw to resist the effects of the spell. 

The spell can disguise physical features, clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. The caster may make the targets appear shorter or taller, thinner or fatter, or any combination thereof. However, the caster cannot change the body type of the target. The illusion lasts for the duration of the spell, unless the caster chooses to dismiss it earlier.

The changes wrought by this spell are not permanent and can be detected with physical inspection. For example, if the caster adds a hat to a creature's outfit, objects will pass through the hat and anyone who touches it will feel the creature's head and hair. If the caster makes a creature appear thinner than it is, a hand reaching out to touch it will bump into the creature while it is seemingly still in midair.

A creature may use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against the caster's spell save DC. If successful, the creature will become aware of the target's disguise.
