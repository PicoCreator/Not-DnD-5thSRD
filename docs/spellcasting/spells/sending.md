You can send a concise message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature will hear the message in its mind, recognize you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a similar manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least one to understand the meaning of your message.    
You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a five percent chance that the message will not arrive.
