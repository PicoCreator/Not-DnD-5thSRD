# Sending
_A third-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** A single action 
**Range:** Beyond measure 
**Components:** V, S, M (a small length of fine copper wire) 
**Duration:** One round 

You can send a brief missive of no more than twenty-five words to a creature with whom you are familiar. The creature will hear the message in their mind, recognize you as the sender if they know you, and can answer in kind immediately. This spell allows creatures with an Intelligence score of at least one to comprehend the meaning of your message. 
You can send the message across any distance, even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a five percent chance that the message will not arrive.
