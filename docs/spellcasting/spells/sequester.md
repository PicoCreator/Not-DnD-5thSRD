# Sequestration 
_7th-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)    
**Duration:** Until dispelled 

By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When the caster casts the spell and touches the target, it becomes invisible and can't be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.    
If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it does not age.    
The caster can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything the caster chooses, but it must occur or be visible within one mile of the target. Examples include "after 1,000 years" or "when the tarrasque awakens." This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.
