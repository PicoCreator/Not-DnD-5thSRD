# Shapechange
_9th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S, M (a jade circlet worth at least 1,500 gp, which must be placed on the head before casting the spell)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one hour 

The caster takes on the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to or lower than the caster's level. The creature cannot be a construct or an undead, and the caster must have seen the creature at least once. The caster transforms into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.    
The caster's game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though the caster retains their alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The caster also retains all of their skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as the caster and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than the caster's, the creature's bonus is used in place of the caster's. The caster cannot use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.    
The caster assumes the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When reverting to their normal form, the caster returns to the number of hit points they had before transforming. If reverting due to dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to the normal form. As long as the excess damage does not reduce the normal form to 0 hit points, the caster is not knocked unconscious.    
The caster retains the benefit of any features from their class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that the new form is physically capable of doing so. The caster cannot use any special senses they have (for example, darkvision) unless the new form also has that sense. The caster can only speak if the creature can normally speak.    
When transforming, the caster chooses whether their equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. The equipment does not change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form cannot wear must either fall to the ground or merge into the new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.    
During the spell's duration, the caster can use their action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if the new form has more hit points than the current one, the hit points remain at their current value.
