# Thunderous Blast
_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a chip of mica)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

A thunderous ringing sound, unbearably loud, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Every creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. Those who fail the save suffer 3d8 thunder damage, while those who succeed take only half the damage. Creatures made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal have disadvantage on this saving throw.    
Any nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
