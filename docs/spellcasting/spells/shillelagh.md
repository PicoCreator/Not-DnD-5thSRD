# Magickal Maces
_Transmutation Cantrip_

**Casting Time:** A single moment of concentration    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (a sprig of mistletoe, a shamrock leaf, and a mace or quarterstaff)    
**Duration:** One minute 

The mace or quarterstaff you hold is imbued with the power of nature. For the duration, you may use your magical prowess instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of any melee attacks made with the weapon, and the weapon's damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes enchanted, if it wasn't already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.
