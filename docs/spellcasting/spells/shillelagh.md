# Magickal Maces
_Transmutation Cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 Bonus Action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust, a sprig of mistletoe, and a club or quarterstaff)    
**Duration:** 1 Minute 

The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with magickal power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon's damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magickal, if it isn't already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.
