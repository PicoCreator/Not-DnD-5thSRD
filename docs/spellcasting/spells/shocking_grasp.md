_Evocation Cantrip_

**Casting Time:** One Action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

A bolt of lightning leaps from your hand to deliver a powerful shock to a creature you attempt to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have an advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a successful hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and they are unable to take any reactions until the start of their next turn.

The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
