**Casting Time:** 1 action

A spark of electricity leaps from your hand to a creature you attempt to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have an advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing metal armor. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn.    
The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
