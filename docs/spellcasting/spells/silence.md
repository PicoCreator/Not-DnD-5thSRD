# Hush 
_2nd-level illusion (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

For the duration, no sound can be made or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Anything inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while inside it. Casting a spell that requires a verbal component is impossible there.
