# Phantasmagoria 
_7th-level illusion_ 

**Casting Time:** A full day and night    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (snow or ice in quantities sufficient to create a life-size replica of the creature to be duplicated; a lock of hair, a clipping of nails, or some other part of the creature's body placed within the snow or ice; and powdered ruby worth 1,500 gp, sprinkled over the duplicate and consumed by the spell)    
**Duration:** Until dispelled 

You shape a beguiling illusion of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has only half the creature's hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates.    
The phantasmagoria is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The phantasmagoria lacks the capacity to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.    
If the phantasmagoria is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The phantasmagoria lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts away instantly.    
If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed.
