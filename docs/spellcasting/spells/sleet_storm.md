# Glacial Tempest
_3rd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 150 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

A frigid tempest of sleet and snow descends upon the chosen area, a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you select within range. The area is heavily obscured, and any exposed flames are extinguished. The ground is covered in a slick layer of ice, making it difficult terrain. 

When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, they must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they fall prone. If a creature is concentrating on a spell within the area, they must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.
