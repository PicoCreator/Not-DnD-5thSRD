# Winter's Fury
_3rd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 150 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

A fierce winter storm descends upon a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is heavily obscured, and any exposed flames are extinguished. The ground is covered in a slick layer of ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.    
If a creature is concentrating in the area, it must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.
