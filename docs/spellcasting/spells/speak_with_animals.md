# Converse with Beasts 
_1st-level divination (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** 10 minutes 

For the duration, you are granted the power to understand and converse with beasts. The knowledge and understanding of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at the least, beasts can provide you with information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they have seen or heard in the past day. You may be able to persuade a beast to do a small favor for you, at the GM's discretion.
