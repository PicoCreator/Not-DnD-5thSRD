# Converse with Flora
_3rd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Self (30-foot radius)    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Ten minutes 

You bestow upon the plants within 30 feet of you a limited sentience and animation, allowing them to converse with you and obey your simple commands. You may query the plants about events that have transpired in the area within the past day, gaining knowledge of creatures that have passed, the weather, and other occurrences.    
You may also transform difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Alternatively, you may turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to impede pursuers, for example.    
The plants may be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM's discretion. The spell does not enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.    
If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.    
This spell can cause the plants created by the **_entangle_** spell to release a restrained creature.
