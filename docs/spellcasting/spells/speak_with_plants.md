# Speak with Flora 
_3rd-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Self (30-foot radius)    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** 10 minutes 

You bestow limited sentience and animation upon the flora within 30 feet of you, allowing them to communicate with you and obey your simple commands. You can ask the plants about events that have occurred in the area within the past day, gaining knowledge of creatures that have passed, the weather, and other circumstances.    
You can also transform difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Alternatively, you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to impede pursuers, for example.    
The plants may be able to perform other tasks for you, at the GM's discretion. The spell does not enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.    
If a plant creature is in the area, you can converse with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical power to influence it.    
This spell can cause the plants created by the **_entangle_** spell to release a creature that is restrained.
