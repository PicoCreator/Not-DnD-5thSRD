**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Self (15-foot radius)    
**Components:** V, S, M (a holy symbol)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

You summon forth spirits to protect you. They flutter around you in a radius of 15 feet for the duration. If you are of a good or neutral alignment, they take on an angelic or fey form (your choice). If you are of an evil alignment, they appear fiendish.    
When you cast this spell, you can choose any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. Any creature affected by this spell has its speed halved in the area, and when it enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
