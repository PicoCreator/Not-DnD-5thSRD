# Mystic Weapon 
_2nd-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** 1 minute 

You conjure a hovering, spectral weapon within range that remains for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a magical attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.    
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.    
The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (such as St. Cuthbert with his mace and Thor with his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 2nd.
