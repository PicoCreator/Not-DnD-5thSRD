# Spectral Weapon 
_2nd-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** A single bonus action    
**Range:** Sixty feet    
**Components:** Verbal, Somatic    
**Duration:** One minute 

You conjure a spectral weapon that hovers within range for the duration of the spell or until you cast it again. When you cast the spell, you can make a magical attack against a creature within five feet of the weapon. If you hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to twenty feet and make the attack again against a creature within five feet of it.
The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities associated with a particular weapon (such as St. Cuthbert and his mace, or Thor and his hammer) can make the weapon resemble that weapon. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 2nd.
