# Putrid Miasma 
_3rd-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Ninety feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a putrid egg or several skunk cabbage leaves)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute 

You conjure a twenty-foot-radius sphere of noisome, yellow gas centered on a point within range. The miasma spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The miasma lingers in the air for the duration.    
Each creature that is completely within the miasma at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.    
A moderate wind (at least ten miles per hour) disperses the miasma after four rounds. A strong wind (at least twenty miles per hour) disperses it after one round.
