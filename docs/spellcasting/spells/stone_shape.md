# Stone Shaping
_4th-level Transmutation_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into the desired shape of the stone object)    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller, or a section of stone no more than five feet in any dimension, and shape it to your will. With a wave of your hand, you can turn a large rock into a weapon, an idol, or a chest, or carve a small passage through a wall, provided it is no thicker than five feet. You can also shape a stone door or its frame to seal it shut, with up to two hinges and a latch. However, finer details are beyond your power.
