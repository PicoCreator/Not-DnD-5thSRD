You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller, or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension, and shape it to your purpose. For example, you could form a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to close the door. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail is not possible.
