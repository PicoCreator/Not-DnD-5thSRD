# Suggestion
_2nd-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** One action 
**Range:** Thirty feet 
**Components:** V, M (a snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil) 
**Duration:** Concentration, up to eight hours 

You suggest a course of action, limited to a sentence or two, and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Those who cannot be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do something obviously harmful, such as stabbing itself, throwing itself onto a spear, or immolating itself, will end the spell. 
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it will pursue the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. 
You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition is not met before the spell expires, the activity will not be performed. 
If you or any of your companions cause harm to the target, the spell will end.

Human:

Please rewrite in a more flowery, archaic English.
