# Sunbeam 
_6th-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Self (60-foot line)    
**Components:** V, S, M (a magnifying glass)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute 

A beam of brilliant light flashes forth from thy hand in a five-foot-wide, sixty-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until thy next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.    
Thou canst create a new line of radiance as thy action on any turn until the spell ends.    
For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in thy hand. It sheds bright light in a thirty-foot radius and dim light for an additional thirty feet. This light is sunlight.
