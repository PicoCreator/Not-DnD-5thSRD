# Sunbeam 
_6th-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Self (60-foot line)    
**Components:** V, S, M (a magnifying glass)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute 

A brilliant beam of light bursts forth from your hand, stretching out in a five-foot-wide, sixty-foot-long line. Every creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not blinded. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.    
You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.    
For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds a bright light in a thirty-foot radius and dim light for an additional thirty feet. This light is the light of the sun.
