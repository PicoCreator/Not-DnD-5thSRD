A brilliant flash of sunlight bursts forth from a point of your choosing within range, illuminating a sixty-foot radius. Every creature within the light must make a Constitution saving throw. Those who fail are dealt twelve d6 of radiant damage and are blinded for one minute. Those who succeed take half the damage and are not blinded. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw. 

At the end of each of its turns, a creature blinded by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw. If successful, the creature is no longer blinded. 

This spell dispels any darkness created by a spell within its area.
