**Duration:** Instantaneous 

A brilliant flash of sunlight bursts forth in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Every creature in the light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded for one minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not blinded. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.    
A creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the creature is no longer blinded.    
This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.
