# Telekinetic Mastery
_5th-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Sixty feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to ten minutes 

You gain the power to move or manipulate creatures and objects with your mind. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can use your will to affect one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can target the same creature or object round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.    
**Creature.** You can attempt to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature's Strength check. If you succeed, you can move the creature up to thirty feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is held in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.    
On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.    
**Object.** You can attempt to move an object that weighs up to one thousand pounds. If the object isn't being worn or carried, you can automatically move it up to thirty feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.    
If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature's Strength check. If you succeed, you can pull the object away from that creature and move it up to thirty feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.    
You can use your telekinetic grip to manipulate objects with great finesse, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.
