# Mystic Link 
_5th-level divination (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Thirty feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures)    
**Duration:** One hour 

You forge a mystic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically connecting each creature to all the others for the duration. Those with Intelligence scores of two or less are not affected by this spell.    
Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond, regardless of whether they share a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it cannot extend to other planes of existence.
