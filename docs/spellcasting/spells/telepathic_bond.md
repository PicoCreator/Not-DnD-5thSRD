# Mystic Link 
_5th-level divination (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 30 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures)    
**Duration:** 1 hour 

You form a mystic connection between up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Those with Intelligence scores of 2 or less are not affected by this spell.    
Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond, regardless of whether they share a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it cannot extend to other planes of existence.
