# Magickal Circles 
_5th-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 minute    
**Range:** 10 feet    
**Components:** V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes)    
**Duration:** 1 round 

As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with symbols that link your location to a permanent magickal circle of your choice whose symbol sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.    
Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent magickal circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique symbol sequence--a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the symbol sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional symbol sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new symbol sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.    
You can create a permanent magickal circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.
