# Thunderous Blast 
_1st-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Self (15-foot cube)    
**Components:** Verbal, Somatic    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

A wave of thunderous force erupts from your person, shaking the very ground beneath your feet. All creatures within a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. Those who fail are dealt 2d8 thunder damage and are pushed 10 feet away from you. Those who succeed take half the damage and are not pushed. 
In addition, any unsecured objects within the area of effect are pushed 10 feet away from you, and the spell emits a thunderous boom that can be heard up to 300 feet away. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
