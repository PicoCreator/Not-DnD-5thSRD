_5th-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** Verbal, Somatic    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute 

You gain the power to enter a tree and traverse from within it to another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You must expend five feet of movement to enter a tree. You immediately know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the movement used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you're in. You appear in a spot of your choice within five feet of the destination tree, using another five feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within five feet of the tree you entered.    
You can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration. You must end each turn outside a tree.
