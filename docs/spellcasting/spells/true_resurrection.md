You may touch a creature that has been deceased for no longer than two centuries and that passed away for any reason other than old age. If the soul of the creature is free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points. 
This spell will close all wounds, neutralize any poison, cure all diseases, and lift any curses that were affecting the creature when it died. The spell will also replace any damaged or missing organs and limbs. 
The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature's name aloud. The creature will then appear in an unoccupied space of your choosing within ten feet of you.
