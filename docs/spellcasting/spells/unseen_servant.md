# Unseen Servant 
_1st-level conjuration (ritual)_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Sixty feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)    
**Duration:** One hour 

This spell conjures an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that will obey your commands until the spell expires. The servant will appear in an unoccupied space on the ground within range, and has an AC of 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, the spell will end.

Once per turn, as a bonus action, you may mentally command the servant to move up to fifteen feet and interact with an object. It can perform simple tasks such as fetching items, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant will do its best to complete the task, and then await your next command.

If you command the servant to perform a task that would take it more than sixty feet away from you, the spell will end.
