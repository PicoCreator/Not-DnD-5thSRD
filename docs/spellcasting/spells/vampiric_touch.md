_3rd-level Necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 Action    
**Range:** Self    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

The grasp of your shadowy hand can draw life force from others to mend your wounds. Make a magical attack against a creature within your reach. On a successful strike, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage inflicted. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
