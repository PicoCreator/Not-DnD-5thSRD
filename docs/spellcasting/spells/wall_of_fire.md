# Wall of Flame
_4th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** A single action 
**Range:** 120 feet 
**Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus) 
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute 

You conjure a wall of flame upon a solid surface within range. You can create the wall to be up to sixty feet long, twenty feet high, and one foot thick, or a ringed wall up to twenty feet in diameter, twenty feet high, and one foot thick. The wall is opaque and will remain for the duration. 
When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature will take 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. 
One side of the wall, chosen by you when you cast this spell, will deal 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within ten feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature will take the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall will not cause any damage. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
