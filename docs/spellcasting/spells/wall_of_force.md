# Barrier of Might
_5th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powder made from crushing a clear gemstone)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

At a point of your choosing within range, an invisible wall of force appears. You may choose the orientation of the wall, whether it be horizontal, vertical, or at an angle. It may be free-floating or resting on a solid surface. You may shape it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you may form it into ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be connected to another. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It will remain for the duration. If the wall appears in a creature's space, the creature will be pushed to one side of the wall (your choice).

Nothing can pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and cannot be dispelled by **_dispel magic_**. However, a **_disintegrate_** spell will instantly destroy the wall. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.
