# Wall of Force 
_5th-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** One hundred and twenty feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powder made from crushing a clear gemstone)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to ten minutes 

An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point chosen by thee within range. The wall appears in any orientation chosen, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. It can be formed into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to ten feet, or it can be shaped into a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is one-quarter of an inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (thee may choose which side).    
Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and cannot be dispelled by **_dispel magic_**. A **_disintegrate_** spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.
