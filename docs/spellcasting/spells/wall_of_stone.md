# Wall of Stone 
_5th-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a small block of granite)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

A formidable barrier of solid stone materializes at a point of your choosing within range. The wall is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels, each of which must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you may create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.    
If the wall appears in a creature's space, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.    
The wall can take any shape you desire, though it cannot occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall does not need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.    
If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.    
The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM's discretion.    
If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.
