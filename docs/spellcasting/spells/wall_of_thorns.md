# Wall of Thorns 
_6th-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of thorns)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

You conjure a formidable barrier of thorns, which appears within range on a solid surface and remains for the duration. You may choose to create a wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a circle with a 20-foot diameter and up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. This wall blocks line of sight.    
When the wall appears, all creatures within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail the save take 7d8 piercing damage, while those who succeed take only half as much.    
Though a creature may pass through the wall, it is a slow and painful process. For every foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend four feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail the save take 7d8 slashing damage, while those who succeed take only half as much. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.
