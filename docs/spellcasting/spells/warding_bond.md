# Warding Bond 
_2nd-level abjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** One action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)    
**Duration:** One hour 

This spell creates a mystical bond between you and a willing creature you touch, warding them until the spell ends. As long as the target remains within sixty feet of you, they shall be granted a +1 bonus to their Armor Class and saving throws, and they shall be resistant to all forms of damage. Whenever the target takes damage, you shall suffer the same amount.

The spell shall end if either you or the target drop to zero hit points, or if you and the target become separated by more than sixty feet. It can also be dismissed as an action, or if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures.
