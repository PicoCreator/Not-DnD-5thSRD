# Phantasmagoria
_9th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 120 feet   
**Components:** V, S   
**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute 

You draw upon the deepest fears of a group of creatures, conjuring up illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. All creatures within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is filled with dread for the duration of the spell. The illusion calls upon the creature's worst nightmares, manifesting them as an implacable foe. At the end of each of the frightened creature's turns, they must make a Wisdom saving throw or suffer 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
