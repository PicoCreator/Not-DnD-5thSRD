# Wind Stride 
_6th-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 minute    
**Range:** 30 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (fire and holy water)    
**Duration:** 8 hours 

You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range are granted the ability to take on a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. Whilst in this cloud form, a creature is granted a flying speed of 300 feet and is resistant to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting to one's normal form takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and unable to move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.    
If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it cannot land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.
