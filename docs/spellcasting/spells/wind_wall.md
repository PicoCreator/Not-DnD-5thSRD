# Wind Wall
_3rd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 120 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A wall of powerful wind rises from the ground at a point of your choosing within range. You can shape the wall to be up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can form the wall in any way you desire, so long as it is one continuous path along the ground. The wall will remain for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. Those who fail the save will take 3d8 bludgeoning damage, while those who succeed will take half as much.

The strong wind will keep fog, smoke, and other gases away. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects cannot pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall will be blown upwards. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall will be deflected upwards and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through it.
