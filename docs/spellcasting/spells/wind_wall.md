# Tempestuous Barrier
_3rd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

A formidable wall of powerful wind springs forth from the ground at a point of your choosing within range. You can shape the wall to be up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can form the wall in any manner you desire, so long as it is a continuous path along the ground. The wall will remain for the duration of the spell.    
When the wall appears, all creatures within its area must make a Strength saving throw. Those who fail the save will take 3d8 bludgeoning damage, while those who succeed will take half as much.    
The powerful wind will keep away fog, smoke, and other gases. Smaller flying creatures or objects cannot pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall will be swept up by the wind. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall will be deflected upwards and will automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through it.
