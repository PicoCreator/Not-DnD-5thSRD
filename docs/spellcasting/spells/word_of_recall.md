# Word of Recollection 
_6th-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 5 feet    
**Components:** V    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you are instantly transported to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in the closest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell will have no effect.    
You must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within a location, such as a temple, devoted to or strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that isn't devoted to your deity, the spell will have no effect.
