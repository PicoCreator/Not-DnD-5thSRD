# Zone of Veracity 
_2nd-level enchantment_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** 10 minutes 

You conjure a magical zone that protects against falsehoods in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, any creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or begins its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is unable to utter a single untruth while within the radius. You are aware of the success or failure of each creature's saving throw.    
An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.
