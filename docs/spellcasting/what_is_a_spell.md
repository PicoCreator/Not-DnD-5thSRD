# What is a Spell?
A spell is a powerful and mysterious force, a weaving of the magical energies that permeate the world into a specific, limited expression. When a spell is cast, a spellcaster carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic that fill the air, arranges them in a particular pattern, sets them to vibrate in a certain way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect - all in a matter of moments.

Spells can be used as tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can cause damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions, drain life energy away, and even bring the dead back to life.

Throughout the ages, countless spells have been created and many have been forgotten. Some may still be hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Others may be rediscovered by powerful and wise spellcasters.

## Spell Level
Each spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell's level is an indication of its power, with the humble **_magic missile_** at 1st level and the world-shaking **_wish_** at 9th. Cantrips - simple but powerful spells that can be cast almost instinctively - are level 0. The higher a spell's level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use it.

Spell level and character level do not correspond directly. Generally, a character must be at least 17th level to cast a 9th-level spell.

## Known and Prepared Spells
Before a spellcaster can use a spell, they must have it firmly fixed in their mind, or have access to it in a magic item. Some classes, such as bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells that are always fixed in their minds. The same is true of many magical creatures. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, must prepare their spells. This process varies for different classes, as described in their descriptions.

In all cases, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in their mind at any given time depends on their character level.

## Spell Slots
Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, they can only cast a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally exhausting, and higher-level spells are even more so. Therefore, each spellcasting class's description (except for the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.

When a character casts a spell, they expend a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively "filling" a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size - small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Umara casts **_magic missile_**, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.

After a long rest, any expended spell slots are restored.

Some characters and monsters have special abilities that allow them to cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in this way.

## Casting a Spell at a Higher Level
When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts **_magic missile_** using one of her 2nd-level slots, that **_magic missile_** is 2nd level. In effect, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.

Some spells, such as **_magic missile_** and **_cure wounds_**, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as described in the spell's description.

> ### Casting in Armor 
> Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, one must be proficient with the armor they are wearing to cast a spell. Otherwise, they are too distracted and physically hindered by their armor for spellcasting.

## Cantrips
A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Through repeated practice, the spellcaster has fixed the spell in their mind and infused them with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip's spell level is 0.

## Rituals
Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or it can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also does not expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell cannot be cast at a higher level.

To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants them the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on their list of spells known, unless the character's ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard's does.
